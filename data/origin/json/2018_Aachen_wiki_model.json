        "abstract": "This project involves modeling both the biological processes and the hardware of a Melatonin-sensor system. It aims to understand reaction dynamics, identify key parameters, and predict calibration lines. The model uses Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics and integrates these with hardware models for practical applications.",
        "metadata": {
            "Model Overview": "The model aims to understand the dynamics of reactions in the Melatonin-sensor system and predict its calibration lines. It includes both biological and hardware components.",
            "Model Assumptions": "The models are simplified and do not fully represent the complex realities of enzyme kinetics and hardware interactions.",
            "Mathematical Description": "The biological model uses Michaelis-Menten and Hill kinetics. The hardware model involves an approximation of the LSPR wavelength changes.",
            "Model Implementation": "Implemented using Matlab SimBiology, allowing visual programming and parameter adjustments.",
            "Parameter Estimation": "Parameters were estimated from experimental data and theoretical approximations. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand parameter impacts.",
            "Model Validation and Verification": "Validation included comparing simulation results with expected outcomes and conducting sensitivity analyses.",
            "Simulation Results": "Simulations show how melatonin concentrations affect sensor readings, with visualizations provided in Matlab plots.",
            "Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis": "Sensitivity analysis highlighted the impact of melatonin concentration and reaction rates on the system's performance.",
            "Model Limitations": "Simplified models may not capture all real-world complexities. Hardware model approximations may need refinement.",
            "Conclusions": "The combined model helps in understanding the sensor's functionality and predicting performance. It also provides insights for future improvements.",
