        "input": "Two plasmids were used to activate the pMLPm promoter and induce apoptotic death.",
        "output": "The two plasmids, a Lenti viral plasmid expressing dCas9 enzyme fused to VP64 under the TIMP1 promoter and another plasmid where pSTEAP4 promoter expresses gRNA and pMLPm promoter regulates the downstream translation of reverse caspase3, were used together to activate the pMLPm promoter and induce apoptotic death in A1 reactive astrocytes."

        "instruction": "Explain the procedure for verifying mCherry expression.",
        "input": "mCherry expression was verified using a fluorescent microscope and documented with ARIA FACS and confocal microscope.",
        "output": "To verify mCherry expression, a fluorescent microscope was used on day 3, 24 hours after transfection. Additionally, on day 4, 48 hours after transfection, mCherry expression was documented using both the ARIA FACS and confocal microscope to confirm the activation of the pMLPm promoter and the induction of apoptotic death."
