A synthetic oscillatory network
of transcriptional regulators

..............................................................................................................................................
Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential
functions in living cells1, but the ‘design principles’ underlying the
functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly under-
stood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of
relatively simple systems2. Here we present a complementary
approach to this problem: the design and construction of a
synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used
three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any
natural biological clock3–5 to build an oscillating network, termed

letters to nature

the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically
induces the synthesis of green ﬂuorescent protein as a readout of
its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical
periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the
state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to
generation. This artiﬁcial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly
because of stochastic ﬂuctuations of
its components. Such
‘rational network design’ may lead both to the engineering of
new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of
naturally occurring networks.

In the network shown in Fig. 1a, the ﬁrst repressor protein, LacI
from E. coli, inhibits the transcription of the second repressor gene,
tetR from the tetracycline-resistance transposon Tn10, whose pro-
tein product in turn inhibits the expression of a third gene, cI from l
phage. Finally, CI inhibits lacI expression, completing the cycle.
That such a negative feedback loop can lead to temporal oscillations
in the concentrations of each of its components can be seen from a
simple model of transcriptional regulation, which we used to design
the repressilator and study its possible behaviours (Box 1). In this
model, the action of the network depends on several factors,
including the dependence of transcription rate on repressor con-
centration, the translation rate, and the decay rates of the protein
and messenger RNA. Depending on the values of these parameters,
at least two types of solutions are possible: the system may converge
toward a stable steady state, or the steady state may become
unstable, leading to sustained limit-cycle oscillations (Fig. 1b, c).

We found that oscillations are favoured by strong promoters
coupled to efﬁcient ribosome-binding sites, tight transcriptional
repression (low ‘leakiness’), cooperative repression characteristics,
and comparable protein and mRNA decay rates (Box 1, Fig. 1b). A
general obstacle to the design of biochemical networks is uncer-
tainty about the values of parameters that characterize the interac-
tions between different components. In our network, estimates of
the order of magnitude of the relevant parameters seem to be
compatible with the possibility of oscillations. Nevertheless, to
increase the chances that the artiﬁcial network would function in
the oscillatory regime, we made two alterations to natural compo-
nents. First, to address transcriptional strength and tightness, we
used strong, yet tightly repressible hybrid promoters, developed
previously, which combine the l PL promoter with lac and tet
operator sequences6. Second, to bring the effective repressor protein
lifetimes closer to that of mRNA (about 2 min, on average, in E.
coli7), we inserted a carboxy-terminal tag, based on the ssrA RNA
sequence8, at the 39 end of each repressor gene. Proteases in E. coli
recognize this tag and target the attached protein for destruction9,10.
Such tags have been shown to reduce the half-life of the l repressor
DNA-binding domain from more than 60 min to around 4 min
(ref. 8) and diminish the half-life of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
to about 30–40 min (ref. 11).

With these considerations in mind, we used standard molecular
biology techniques to construct a low-copy plasmid encoding the
repressilator and a compatible, higher-copy reporter plasmid con-
taining the tet-repressible promoter PLtetO1 (ref. 6) fused to an
intermediate stability variant of gfp11 (Fig. 1a). Because the inducer
IPTG interferes with repression by LacI, we expected that a transient
pulse of IPTG might be capable of synchronizing a population of
repressilator-containing cells. A culture of E. coli MC4100 contain-
ing the two plasmids and grown in media containing IPTG
displayed what appeared to be a single damped oscillation of GFP
ﬂuorescence per cell after transfer to media lacking IPTG (results
not shown). Because individual cells have no apparent means of
maintaining synchronization, we studied the repressilator by iso-
lating single cells under the microscope and monitoring their
ﬂuorescence intensity as they grew into small two-dimensional
microcolonies consisting of hundreds of progeny cells. In these
experiments, total observation time was limited by the colony
entering a stationary phase after about 10 hours of growth at

Figure 1 Construction, design and simulation of the repressilator. a, The repressilator
network. The repressilator is a cyclic negative-feedback loop composed of three repressor
genes and their corresponding promoters, as shown schematically in the centre of the
left-hand plasmid. It uses PLlacO1 and PLtetO1, which are strong, tightly repressible
promoters containing lac and tet operators, respectively6, as well as PR, the right promoter
from phage l (see Methods). The stability of the three repressors is reduced by the
presence of destruction tags (denoted ‘lite’). The compatible reporter plasmid (right)
expresses an intermediate-stability GFP variant11 (gfp-aav). In both plasmids, transcrip-
tional units are isolated from neighbouring regions by T1 terminators from the E. coli rrnB
operon (black boxes). b, Stability diagram for a continuous symmetric repressilator model
(Box 1). The parameter space is divided into two regions in which the steady state is stable
(top left) or unstable (bottom right). Curves A, B and C mark the boundaries between the
two regions for different parameter values: A, n (cid:136) 2:1, a0 (cid:136) 0; B, n (cid:136) 2, a0 (cid:136) 0; C,
n (cid:136) 2, a0=a (cid:136) 10 2 3. The unstable region (A), which includes unstable regions (B) and
(C), is shaded. c, Oscillations in the levels of the three repressor proteins, as obtained by

normalized autocorrelation function of the ﬁrst repressor species.

30 8C. At least 100 individual cell lineages in each of three micro-
colonies were tracked manually, and their ﬂuorescence intensity was
quantiﬁed.

The timecourse of the ﬂuorescence of one such cell is shown in
Fig. 2. Temporal oscillations (in this case superimposed on an
overall increase in ﬂuorescence) occur with a period of around
150 minutes, roughly threefold longer than the typical cell-division
time. The amplitude of oscillations is large compared with baseline
levels of GFP ﬂuorescence. At least 40% of cells were found to
exhibit oscillatory behaviour in each of the three movies, as
determined by a Fourier analysis criterion (see Methods). The
range of periods, as estimated by the distribution of peak-to-peak
intervals, is 160 6 40 min (mean 6 s:d:, n (cid:136) 63). After septation,
GFP levels in the two sibling cells often remained correlated with
one another for long periods of time (Fig. 3a–c). Based on the
analysis of 179 septation events in the 3 movies, we measured an
average half-time for sibling decorrelation of 95 6 10 min, which is
longer than the typical cell-division times of 50–70 min under these
conditions. This indicates that the state of the network is trans-
mitted to the progeny cells, despite a strong noise component. We
observed signiﬁcant variations in the period and amplitude of the
oscillator output both from cell to cell (Fig. 3d), and over time in a
single cell and its descendants (Fig. 3a–c). In some individuals,
periods were omitted or phase delayed in one cell relative to its
sibling (Fig. 3a, c).

Recent theoretical work has shown that stochastic effects may
be responsible for noisy operation in natural gene-expression
networks12. Simulations of the repressilator that take into account
the stochastic nature of reaction events and discreteness of network
components also exhibit signiﬁcant variability, reducing the corre-
lation time for oscillations from inﬁnity (in the continuous model)
to about two periods (Box 1, Fig. 1c, insets). In general, we would
like to distinguish such stochastic effects from possible intrinsically
complex dynamics (such as intermittence or chaotic behaviour).
Further studies are needed to identify and characterize the sources
of ﬂuctuations in the repressilator and other designed networks. In
particular, longer experiments performed under chemostatic con-
ditions should enable more complete statistical characterization of

Box 1
Network design

Design of the repressilator started with a simple mathematical model of
transcriptional regulation. We did not set out to describe precisely the
behaviour of the system, as not enough is known abut the molecular
interactions inside the cell to make such a description realistic. Instead,
we hoped to identify possible classes of dynamic behaviour and
determine which experimental parameters should be adjusted to obtain
sustained oscillations.
Deterministic, continuous approximation
Three repressor-protein concentrations, pi, and their corresponding
mRNA concentrations, mi (where i is lacI, tetR or cI) were treated as
continuous dynamical variables. Each of these six molecular species
participates in transcription, translation and degradation reactions. Here
we consider only the symmetrical case in which all three repressors are
identical except for their DNA-binding speciﬁcities. The kinetics of the
system are determined by six coupled ﬁrst-order differential equations:

j (cid:136) cI; lacI; tetR

where the number of protein copies per cell produced from a given
promoter type during continuous growth is a0 in the presence of
saturating amounts of repressor (owing to the ‘leakiness’ of the
promoter), and a (cid:135) a0 in its absence; b denotes the ratio of the protein
decay rate to the mRNA decay rate; and n is a Hill coefﬁcient. Time is
rescaled in units of the mRNA lifetime; protein concentrations are written
in units of KM, the number of repressors necessary to half-maximally
repress a promoter; and mRNA concentrations are rescaled by their
translation efﬁciency, the average number of proteins produced per
mRNA molecule. The numerical solution of the model shown in Fig. 1c
used the following parameter values: promoter strength, 5 3 10 2 4
(repressed) to 0.5 (fully induced) transcripts per s; average translation
efﬁciency, 20 proteins per transcript, Hill coefﬁcient, n (cid:136) 2; protein half-
life, 10 min; mRNA half-life, 2 min; KM, 40 monomers per cell.

This system of equations has a unique steady state, which becomes

unstable domains can therefore be plotted (Fig. 1b). The unstable domain
becomes much larger when the Hill coefﬁcient increases, removing any
limitation on b for sufﬁciently large a (compare curve B, for which n (cid:136) 2,
to curve A, for which n (cid:136) 2:1). The effect of leakiness, a0, can be seen by
plotting the stability boundary for a constant ratio of a0/a, as in curve C.
When a0 becomes comparable to KM (1 in our units), the unstable domain
shrinks (compare curve B, for which a0 (cid:136) 0, to curve C, for which
a0=a (cid:136) 10 2 3). Similar analysis of the stability of the steady state can be
performed for generalized models of cyclic transcriptional feedback
loops. The simplest such networks supporting limit-cycle oscillations are
those containing a single repressor and a single activator, or an odd
number of repressors exceeding 3. In general, the period of oscillations in
such networks is determined mainly by the protein stability16. More
detailed calculations, with non-Hill-function repression curves, or using
thermodynamic binding energies to predict equilibrium operator occu-
pancies, and taking repressor dimerization into account, yield similar
stability results19. It is possible that, in addition to simple oscillations, this
and more realistic models may exhibit other complex types of dynamic
behaviour.
Stochastic, discrete approximation
The preceding analysis neglects the discrete nature of the molecular
components and the stochastic character of their interactions, however.
Such effects are believed to be important in biochemical and genetic
networks12. We therefore adapted the above equations to perform
stochastic simulations, as described20. To obtain cooperativity in
repression analogous to the continuous case, we assumed the presence
of two operator sites on each promoter and the following reactions:
binding of proteins to each operator site (1 nM-1 s-1); unbinding of protein
from the ﬁrst-occupied (224 s-1) and the second-occupied (9 s-1)
operator; transcription from occupied (5 3 10 2 4 s 2 1) and from unoccu-
pied (0.5 s-1) promoters; translation (0.167 mRNA-1 s-1); protein decay
(10 min half-life); and mRNA decay (2 min half-life). These parameters
were chosen to correspond as closely as possible to the continuous
model described above, assuming that 1 molecule per cell corresponds
to a concentration of ,1 nM. Oscillations persist for these parameter
values (Fig. 1c) but with a large variability, resulting in a ﬁnite autocorre-
lation time (compare insets in Fig. 1c).

the noisy repressilator dynamics. In addition, varying the host
species and genetic background would allow us to check for, and
minimize, spurious interactions with endogenous cellular sub-
systems, and to investigate how the network is embedded in the
cell. For instance, in the repressilator network, the cell-division cycle
does not seem to be coupled with the repressilator, as the timing of
oscillations is uncorrelated with cell septation events (Fig. 2).
However, entry into the stationary phase causes the repressilator
to halt,
indicating that the network is coupled to the global
regulation of cell growth.

The levels of many cellular components vary over time in growing
cells, and even strains that constitutively express GFP exhibit
signiﬁcant heterogeneity, so we performed several control experi-
ments to check that the observed oscillations are indeed due to the
repressilator (Fig. 3e, f). These included deliberate disruption of the
network (by adding sufﬁcient IPTG to interfere with LacI) and
observation of GFP expression in the absence of the repressilator
(from plasmids with different promoters and origins of replication).
Our results show that it is possible to design and construct an
artiﬁcial genetic network with new functional properties from
generic components that naturally occur in other contexts. Such
work is analogous to the rational design of functional proteins from
well-characterized motifs13. Further characterization of compo-
nents and alteration of network connectivity may reveal general
features of this and related networks, and provide a basis for
improved design and possible use in biotechnological applications.
Moreover, comparing designed networks with their evolved coun-
terparts may also help us to understand the ‘design principles’
underlying the latter. For instance, circadian clocks are found in
many organisms, including cyanobacteria in which the cell-division
time may be shorter than the period14–15. However, the reliable
performance of such circadian oscillators can be contrasted with the
noisy, variable behaviour of the repressilator. Instead of three
repressors, it seems that circadian oscillators use both positive
and negative control elements. Does this design lead to improved
reliability? Recent theoretical analysis suggests that, in the presence
of interactions between positive and negative control elements
that lead to bistable, hysteretic behaviour, an oscillating circuit
does indeed exhibit high noise-resistance16. It would be interesting
to see whether one could build an artiﬁcial analogue of the circadian
clock, and, if so, whether such an analogue would display the noise
resistance and temperature compensation of its natural counter-
part.

Methods
Network construction
The three repressors (lacI, tetR and cI), the l promoter PR and the unstable variants of gfp11
were all cloned by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and veriﬁed by sequencing. In the
case of lacI, the GTG start codon was changed to ATG with the 59 primer. 39 PCR primers
were used to add the coding sequence for the 11-amino-acid ssrA tag to the three
repressors8. Tagging of full-length l repressor, as well as lacI and tetR, resulted in
functional proteins that required increased induction to achieve full repression, consistent
with decreased stability. Promoter sequences PLlacO1 and PLtetO1 were obtained from
pZE21-MCSI and pZE12-luc6. The repressilator plasmid was constructed in three
successive cloning steps from intermediate plasmids containing the three transcriptional
units. The reporter plasmid was constructed by cloning the GFPaav variant11, which has a
half-life of around 90 min, into pZE21-MCS1 (ref. 6). The ﬁnite rate at which GFP is
oxidized to its ﬂuorescent form17 and its relatively long half-life limit our ability to observe
fast dynamic phenomena. The presence of additional tet operators on the reporter plasmid
constitutes a perturbation to the single-plasmid repressilator network by titrating out
repressors18.

Data acquisition and analysis
Cells of E. coli lac- strain MC4100 (unless otherwise speciﬁed) transformed with
appropriate plasmids were grown in minimal media (7.6 mM [NH4]2SO4, 2 mM MgSO4,
30 mM FeSO4, 1 mM EDTA, 60 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8) supplemented with
0.5% glycerol, 0.1% casamino acids and appropriate antibiotics (20 mg ml-1 kanamycin or
20 mg ml-1 ampicillin), when needed. Time-lapse microscopy was conducted on a Zeiss
Axiovert 135TV microscope equipped with a 512 3 512-pixel cooled CCD camera
(Princeton Instruments). Cultures were grown for at least 10 hours to optical density of 0.1
at 600 nm, diluted into fresh media, spotted between a coverslip and 1 ml of liquid 2%

SeaPlaque low-melt agarose (FMC) in media, and sealed. The temperature of the samples
was maintained at 30–32 8C by using Peltier devices (Melcor). Bright-ﬁeld (0.1 s) and
epiﬂuorescence (0.05–0.5 s) exposures were taken periodically (every 5 or 10 min). All
light sources (standard 100 W Hg and halogen lamps) were shuttered between exposures.
Images were ﬂat-ﬁeld corrected with custom software. For the synchronization experi-
ment, overnight cultures were diluted back 1:100 in media containing 100 mM IPTG,
grown to mid-log, washed several times, and diluted again and grown in 96-well plates at
30 with shaking in a Wallac Victor 2 plate reader, while ﬂuorescence and absorbance
measurements were taken every 5 min.

For analysis, cells were selected from the ﬁnal frames of bright-ﬁeld movies, without

regard to their ﬂuorescence signals, and tracked manually backward in time until the ﬁrst
frame. At each time point, the cell position was identiﬁed on the bright-ﬁeld image, and
ﬂuorescence intensity data were averaged over a 28-pixel region, similar in size to the cell
diameter, in the corresponding location on the ﬂuorescence image. A fast Fourier
transform was applied to the temporal ﬂuorescence signal from each analysed cell lineage
and divided by the transform of a decaying exponential with a time constant of 90 min, the
measured lifetime of GFPaav. Power spectra exhibiting peaks of more than four times the
background at frequencies of 0.2–0.5 per hour were classiﬁed as oscillatory (the choice of
threshold alters the fraction of oscillatory cells deﬁned by this criterion). The sibling
‘decorrelation’ half-time was deﬁned as the time necessary for the quantity
jI1(cid:133)t(cid:134) 2 I2(cid:133)t(cid:134)j=(cid:133)I1(cid:133)t(cid:134) (cid:135) I2(cid:133)t(cid:134)(cid:134), averaged over pairs of daughter cells, to reach half of its
asymptotic value. Here, I1(t) and I2(t) denote the ﬂuorescence intensities of the two sibling
cells at times, t, starting from the moment of septation (610 min). In this analysis, only
cells judged to be oscillatory by the Fourier criterion were considered.

Various negative control experiments were performed. First, 50 mM IPTG was added to
the media to disrupt the functioning of the network (Fig. 3e). Second, we used a version of
the repressilator plasmid lacking all but the tetR transcriptional unit (in lacIq strain
JM109). We thus varied GFP expression of the reporter plasmid by controlling TetR levels
with 0–20 mM IPTG. Third, we examined cells containing only the reporter plasmid
(Fig. 3f). Fourth, we measured GFP expression from reporter plasmids modiﬁed in several
ways either by replacing the PLtetO1 promoter with each of the two other promoters, and
gfp-aav with gfp-lite11 (the sufﬁx ‘lite’ indicates the presence of a C-terminal ssrA tag), or by
replacing the ColE1 origin of replication with the lower-copy pSC101 origin normally
used on the repressilator plasmid. In none of these control experiments did we observe
oscillations similar to those produced by the repressilator.
