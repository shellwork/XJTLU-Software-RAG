Abstract There is pressing need to understand the aging
process to better cope with its associated physical and societal
costs. The age-related muscle wasting known as sarcopenia is
a major contributor to the problems faced by the elderly. By
hindering mobility and reducing strength, it greatly diminishes
independence and quality of life. In studying the factors that
contribute to the development of sarcopenia, the focus is
shifting to the study of disordered muscle anabolism. The
abnormal response of muscle to previously well-established
anabolic stimuli is known as anabolic resistance, and may be a
key factor in the development and progression of sarcopenia.
Factors such as age, obesity, inflammation, and lipotoxicity
contribute to anabolic resistance, and have been studied either
directly or indirectly in cell systems and whole animals.
Understanding the physiologic and mechanistic basis of ana-
bolic resistance could be the key to formulating new and
targeted interventions that would ease the burden currently
borne by the world’s aged population.

1 Introduction

The rapid growth of the world’s aging population has sparked
many discussions of the public health implications of aging.
The WHO has estimated that the expansion of the population

aged 60 and over will more than triple from 600 million to
greater than two billion between 2000 and 2050 [1]. With a
projected global population of approximately nine billion by
the year 2050, between one fifth and one quarter of the world
would fall into this category. Increasingly, older adults play an
active role in caregiving, volunteerism, and many other inte-
gral social facets. Consider, too, the susceptibility of the
elderly to disease and the accompanying debilitation. Taken
together, these circumstances highlight the importance of
understanding the etiology of the aging process and the un-
derlying metabolic alterations that occur.

In the past decades, substantial research has revealed that
large sections of the older population suffer from loss of
muscle mass and function, which has been shown to contrib-
ute to functional limitations and disability [2, 3]. This age-
related muscle wasting has been termed sarcopenia [4]. Re-
cently it has been observed that sarcopenia incurs a significant
cost to the American Health System, so a better understanding
of the disease etiology as well as development of interven-
tional therapy cannot only have a profound impact on the
individual level but on a much larger scale as well [5].

Mechanistically, muscle loss as a result of sarcopenia is
better understood now than it was some 15 years ago. Prefer-
ential loss of type II muscle fibers is characteristic and seen in
individuals as early as the age of 25, but the loss of muscle
function to actual tissue loss seems disproportionate: strength
diminishes more than muscle loss would predict [6, 7]. Re-
cently, studies have implicated a derangement of equilibrium
between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein
breakdown (MPB) as a major contributor to this phenomenon.
In particular, alterations in MPS during anabolic conditions in
aged populations have been implicated as a significant con-
tributor to this imbalance [6, 8, 9].

Anabolic resistance, the impaired rate of cellular anabo-
lism in response to various anabolic stimuli, is one potential

mechanism of disordered MPS [8]. The inability of muscle
to regulate maintenance of protein homeostasis in response
to feeding and exercise is characteristic in older individuals.
Investigation into both normal and disordered muscle anab-
olism has provided unique insight to this problem [9, 10].

2 Anabolic stimuli and signaling

Anabolic stimulators such as insulin, branched chain amino
acids (BCAA), and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1) increase
skeletal MPS in young healthy individuals. Anabolic stimula-
tion in skeletal muscle causes MPS to exceed MPB, resulting in
muscle hypertrophy. Insulin has been well described as a
stimulator of MPS and has also been seen to participate in
muscle amino acid uptake [11–14]. However, more recent
findings have highlighted insulin as permissive rather than
modulatory in MPS. Insulin acts to prime the muscle for
protein synthesis, but MPS is stimulated in a dose-dependent
fashion by BCAA in young men. So availability of BCAA
rather than insulin appears to regulate rate of protein synthesis
observed [15]. Additionally, IGF-1 has also been shown to
induce hypertrophy in muscle [16]. While these stimuli consti-
tute the most commonly studied and well-characterized dietary
and homeostatic drivers of MPS, exercise has also been shown
to affect the dynamics of muscle equilibrium.

For years now exercise has been studied in the context of
sarcopenic muscle loss [17, 18]. Aerobic exercise, while hav-
ing no observable impact on muscle protein turnover, has been
shown to increase MPS in older individuals [19]. Muscle
contraction by resistance exercise increases the overall rate
of muscle protein turnover, but does so disproportionately in
favor of MPS [12]. Other studies have reported that an intense
single bout of resistance training can increase MPS well above
baseline in the post-exercise time period that extends from 1 to
72 h [20–22]. Similar to BCAA availability, acute bouts of
resistance training have been shown to affect MPS in a dose-
dependent manner [23].

Anabolic signals provoke MPS by activating a highly
diverse signaling pathway in skeletal muscle cells. The mam-
malian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a member
of a family of signaling proteins that serve a myriad of roles in
stress and survival pathways. Two distinct mTOR complexes,
mTORC1 and mTORC2, act as nutrient sensors that are
activated under specific conditions. In response to anabolic
stimuli, mTORC1 targets and activates downstream kinases
such as S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), or binding proteins like eIF4E-
binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), as seen in Fig. 1. The action of
mTOR and its downstream mediators heightens the efficiency
of ribosomal biogenesis and ultimately translation [24–26].
Additionally, the energy sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)
holds a measure of control over mTORC1, and the two together
exert antagonistic control over muscle cell size [27].

Protein kinase B, also known as Akt, plays an important
role in skeletal muscle homeostasis. A target of mTORC2,
Akt is a member of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)
family and involved in stress and survival signaling. It acts
through control over the forkhead box protein O (FOXO) 1
and FOXO3 transcription factors, which mediate cellular
stress responses such as apoptosis [28]. Akt has also been
observed to play a role in lipid metabolism, meaning it may
have additional culpability in disordered anabolic signaling
[29, 30]. Zoncu et al. and Rivas et al. have written detailed
reviews on these signaling pathways and their function in
skeletal muscle homeostasis; they should be referenced for
additional details [28, 34].

3 Anabolic resistance and aging

As aging is seen to be the root cause of sarcopenia, it has
been studied as a potential root of the underlying problem,
anabolic resistance. The study of anabolic resistance in both
human and rodent models has allowed for a translational
approach in determining the mechanism of disordered skeletal
muscle metabolism. Initially, a study by Guillet and col-
leagues showed that the ability of insulin and BCAA to initiate
protein translation was hampered in older individuals when
compared with young subjects as well [31]. Rassmussen and
colleagues corroborated these findings while also pointing out
that a blunted vasodilatory response of older muscle to insulin
may play a role in nutrient deficiency and unavailability [32].
It was also revealed that the ability of BCAA to foster MPS
was blunted in old rats compared with their younger adult
counterparts [10]. This observed decrease in MPS in response
to anabolic stimulus with aging is thought to be a result of
diminished mTOR signaling [26].

Precedent for diminished mTOR signaling in response to
anabolic stimulus was established through experimentation
with rapamycin, an immunosuppressant and inhibitor of mTOR
phosphorylation [33–35]. Cuthbertson and colleagues have
observed decreased mTOR phosphorylation in older individu-
als as compared to young individuals in response to BCAA
[15]. Others have seen attenuation of the mTOR signaling
pathway despite muscle contraction or overload in aged ani-
mals [36–39]. Overall, there seems to be consensus that age-
induced anabolic resistance is grounded in the inability of
hypertrophy controlling signaling pathways to successfully
coordinate the proper response to their normal stimuli.

4 Diet, obesity, and diminished anabolic signaling

Approximately one decade ago, a study by Baumgartner
revealed that older individuals categorized as both sarcopenic
and obese were at the highest risk among those suffering from

Fig. 1 Anabolic stimuli in the form of amino acids, growth factors
(insulin, IGF-1), and exercise (not shown) act through the mTOR and
Akt signaling pathways. mTORC1 is responsible for the phosphoryla-
tion and activation of S6K1 and phosphorylation and inactivation of
4E-BP1. It results in ribosome biogenesis, increase in translational
efficiency, and heightened MPS. The energy sensor AMPK inhibits
this pathway, and is active when the AMP/ATP ratio is high. Growth

factor stimulates activation of the PI3K pathway as well as mTORC2;
both eventually activate Akt, which can inhibit stress signaling and
apoptosis through inactivation of FOXO1/O3 transcription factors. Akt
also plays a role in carbohydrate metabolism. P phosphorylation,

disorders of body composition [40]. Further investigation of
this “sarcopenic obesity” would indicate that the two are path-
ophysiologically linked, perhaps even at a mechanistic level
[41]. It comes as no surprise then that anabolic resistance has
been observed to arise in response to obesity and high-fat
feeding. Diet-induced obesity is often implicated in insulin
resistance when studied as a contributor to metabolic syndrome
[42]. A study in mice conducted by Anderson and colleagues
showed that diet-induced obesity reduced skeletal MPS in
response to nutrient intake [43]. Yet another study was able to
find a link between impaired protein metabolism and reduced
post-absorptive protein turnover in obese individuals [44].

In spite of compelling evidence, it is yet unclear how
obesity and insulin resistance are linked mechanistically. It
has been shown that increased activation of the mTOR
pathway can diminish the ability of Akt to function properly
in fat-fed obese rats [45]. The downstream effectors of the
mTOR pathway have also been implicated as contributors to
insulin resistance stemming from obesity [46]. Some mech-
anistic insight into anabolic signaling has been gleaned

through the study of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB),
an active leucine metabolite. HMB has been shown to
increase MPS through activation of the mTOR pathway
and to attenuate MPB through various anticatabolic actions,
such as inhibition of caspase-8 signaling [47–49]. Still, the
lack of concrete mechanisms for the roles of obesity and
anabolic signaling in anabolic resistance makes this a rich
area for study moving forward.

5 Inflammation and lipotoxicity

Obesity aside, lipid accumulation may have another impor-
tant role in anabolic signaling and resistance. Accumulation
of lipids in nonfatty tissue sites has been linked with acti-
vation of proinflammatory mediators such as toll-like recep-
tor 4, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells
(NFκB) [50]. Several studies have shown that inflammation,
mediated by these same intermediaries, may play a key role

160

J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle (2012) 3:157–162

in the development of sarcopenia, especially through ana-
bolic resistance [51, 52]. Cuthbertson and colleagues have
suggested that increased basal expression of NFκB, as well
as TNFα and interleukin-6, in older individuals is an inhib-
itor of muscle anabolism by interference with mTOR sig-
naling [15]. Inflammation like this is viewed as chronic in
older individuals, characterized by heightened production of
cytokines and acute-phase proteins; the phenomenon has
come to be called “inflammaging” by some [53–56]. Fur-
thermore, recent findings have linked lipid accumulation to
proinflammatory macrophage infiltration in muscle tissue
and intermuscular adipose tissue; this is certainly detrimen-
tal, as fatty acids can trigger macrophage secretion of factors
that would further impair anabolic stimulation [57–59].

Lipotoxicity contributes to anabolic resistance through
the action of ceramides, sphingolipids composed of a sphin-
gosine backbone and fatty acid chain. Ceramides function as
regulators of cellular stress and are mechanistic modulators
of metabolic diseases, especially insulin/anabolic resistance
[60–62]. Hyde and colleagues reported that ceramide dimin-
ished intracellular amino acid availability and reduced phos-
phorylation of translational regulators downstream of
mTOR in vitro [63]. Others have gone on to show that
ceramide activates protein phosphatase 2A, which targets
and inhibits Akt and S6K1 by dephosphorylation [64–66]. It
has been hypothesized that ceramides are mediators of
TNFα inhibition of anabolic signaling; but as of yet, there
has been no mechanistic link between the two [67, 68].

Ceramide is not the only lipid species implicated in lip-
otoxicity; triglycerides have also been seen as detrimental to
anabolic signaling in skeletal muscle. Recently, we were
able to show that age-induced intramuscular triglyceride
infiltration is associated with an increase in several lipo-
genic regulators including: sterol regulatory element-
binding protein, fatty acid synthase, acetyl CoA carboxyl-
ase, and stearoyl CoA desaturase. Additionally, we demon-
strated that AMPK activation and concentration are
heightened in aged skeletal muscle, even in animals that
were subjected to anabolic stimulus in the form of chronic
muscle overload [69]. This would suggest that intramuscular
lipid accumulation, especially of triglycerides, is somehow
involved in the blunting of anabolic signaling pathways.
Further investigation in this vein is warranted, as elucidation
of the mechanistic underpinnings of lipotoxicity could pres-
ent new and better ways to intervene in anabolic resistance
at the protein or genetic level, stemming sarcopenia at the
source.

6 Future directions

Clearly, the story of anabolic resistance is compelling, but
still being written. Further exploration of the mechanistic

similarities between aging and obesity would clarify wheth-
er or not there is a link between resistances observed in both
cases. From an interventional standpoint, diet and exercise
could be better tailored to sarcopenia of specific origin to
optimize recovery of muscle mass and function. But where
intervention in diet and with exercise may be less effective,
as in the oldest of individuals, development of therapeutic or
pharmaceutical agents is warranted. A better idea of the role
metabolic or age-related inflammation plays in anabolic
resistance would be necessary to develop targeted counter-
measures. Similarly, understanding how lipid infiltration
and lipotoxicity adversely impact anabolic signaling at the
genetic, protein, and metabolic levels is an area ripe for
study. Luckily, this field of study is relatively new, so
developments in all these areas will come in time. And with
an improved understanding of anabolic resistance, we can
better apply ourselves to the treatment of sarcopenia, there-
by reducing the subsequent burden of disability from this
condition.
