The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature
allows populations to adapt to diverse environments1,2. However,
genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new
phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales3. Although in
vitro and directed evolution methods4–9 have created genetic
variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited
to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used
for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or
genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineer-
ing (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells.
MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome
for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus
producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is
cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that auto-
mate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous
generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, inser-
tions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-
xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia
coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene.
Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modi-
fied simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA,
creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day.
We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene
production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing
metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach
embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting
the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved
properties.

With the advent of next-generation fluorescent DNA sequencing10,
our ability to sequence genomes has greatly outpaced our ability to
modify genomes. Existing cloning-based technologies are confined to
serial and inefficient introduction of single DNA constructs into cells,
requiring laborious and outdated genetic engineering techniques.
Whereas in vivo methods such as recombination-based genetic
engineering (recombineering) have enabled efficient modification of
single genetic targets using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)11–14, no
such attempts have been made to modify genomes on a large and
parallel scale. MAGE provides a highly efficient, inexpensive and auto-
mated solution to simultaneously modify many genomic locations
(for example, genes, regulatory regions) across different length scales,
from the nucleotide to the genome level (Fig. 1).

Efficiency of the MAGE process was characterized using a modi-
fied E. coli strain (EcNR2). Mediated by the bacteriophage l-Red
ssDNA-binding protein b, allelic replacement is achieved in EcNR2
by directing ssDNA or oligonucleotides (oligos) to the lagging strand

of the replication fork during DNA replication14. We optimized a
number of parameters (see Supplementary Information, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1) to maximize efficiency of
oligo-mediated allelic replacement. To generate sequence diversity
in any region of the chromosome by allelic replacement, a pool of
targeting oligos is repeatedly introduced into a cell. Under optimized
conditions, we can successfully introduce new genetic modifications
in .30% of the cell population (Supplementary Fig. 2d) every
2–2.5 h.

Oligo-mediated allelic replacement is capable of introducing a
variety of genetic modifications at high efficiency. The efficiency of
generating a mismatch or insertion modification is correlated to the
amount of homologous sequence between the oligo and its chromo-
somal target (Fig. 2a, b); the efficiency of producing a deletion modi-
fication is correlated to the size of the deletion (Fig. 2c). Figure 2d
shows that the predicted two-state hybridization free energy DG (ref.
15) between the oligo and target chromosomal sequence is a pre-
dictor of the allelic replacement efficiency. Thus, in a pool of oligos
with degenerate sequences, oligos with more homology to the target
will be incorporated in the chromosome at a higher frequency than
those with less homology. This feature of MAGE enables tunable
generation of divergent sequences along favourable evolutionary
paths.

Figure 1 | Multiplex automated genome engineering enables the rapid and
continuous generation of sequence diversity at many targeted
chromosomal locations across a large population of cells through the
repeated introduction of synthetic DNA. Each cell contains a different set of
mutations, producing a heterogeneous population of rich diversity (denoted
by distinct chromosomes in different cells). Degenerate oligo pools that
target specific genomic positions enable the generation of a diverse set of
sequences at each chromosomal location.

To determine the rate at which MAGE generates sequence diversity,
we used three different 90-mer oligos to produce mismatch changes in
a targeted region of the lacZ gene in three distinct cell populations. The
cN6 and cN30 oligos contained 6 and 30 consecutive degenerate bases,
respectively; the iN6 oligos contained 6 degenerate bases interspersed
across a 30-bp region (Fig. 3). For these cell populations, the targeted
lacZ region was sequenced in 96 random clonal isolates after MAGE
cycles 2, 5, 10 and 15 that provided a snapshot of the genotypic vari-
ation in each population. Through successive cycles of MAGE, the
chromosomal sequence of the lacZ region increasingly diverged away
from wild type (Fig. 3). For cN6, after five MAGE cycles, we detected
an average change of 3.1 bp per cell across the population (Fig. 3 inset,
blue line), which equates to the generation of more than 4.3 3 109 bp

Figure 3 | Sequence diversity generated across three separate cell
populations as a function of the number of MAGE cycles. Three 90-mer
oligo pools were investigated: cN30, iN6 and cN6. cN30 contains oligos with
30 bp of consecutive degeneracy; iN6 contains oligos with 6 bp of degeneracy
spaced every 5 bp; cN6 contains oligos with 6 bp of consecutive degeneracy.
Frequency of strains in each population that contains 0 to 71 bp of
differences from the wild-type lacZ sequence are colour-coded. The inset
shows average number of base pairs changed from wild type across the whole
cell population as a function of the number of MAGE cycles using the three

of variation per day (3.1 bp changes per five cycles in 7 3 108 cells at 10
cycles per day). Within 15 cycles, cell populations containing all
possible N6 genotype combinations were generated using either cN6
or iN6 oligos. Because the replacement efficiency for a 30-bp mis-
matching oligo is lower (1.5% from Fig. 2a), only 21.8% of the
cN30 cell population had undergone allelic replacement after 15
cycles. We detected an average change of 5.6 bp per cell from the
wild-type sequence across the whole cN30 population (Fig. 3 inset,
orange line).

The depth at which MAGE generates diversity is determined by a
combination of three factors: (1) the degree of sequence variation
desired at each locus; (2) the number of loci targeted; and (3) the
number of MAGE cycles performed. When a single locus is targeted
using a degenerate oligo pool, genetic diversity is generated across the
population at that locus and is a function of the oligo pool complexity
only. If more than one locus is targeted simultaneously, diversity is
generated through the combinatorial arrangement of the different

the cell population, cells are then recovered and grown to mid-log phase
(7 3 108 cells ml21) in liquid medium for the subsequent cycle.

modified loci. The frequency at which each locus is modified can be
computationally predicted through a binomial distribution
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Although the cell population at any cycle
may reflect only a subset of all variants theoretically possible, we can
cumulatively generate more variants than the actual size of the cell
population (,7 3 108 cells) through successive MAGE cycles. Thus,
we can generate all variants regardless of population size through
computational predictions and continuous cycling by MAGE.

Given the cyclical and scalable nature of our approach, we con-
structed an integrated prototype device that automates the MAGE
process to enable fast and reliable cellular programming. The device
contains growth chambers to maintain healthy cell cultures and elec-
troporation modules to repeatedly deliver DNA into the cells, thereby
facilitating genome engineering and evolution (Fig. 4, Methods and
Supplementary Information). Complex culturing conditions can be
programmed into the device for growth of a diverse set of organisms
and ecosystems.

To demonstrate an application of the MAGE process, we optimized
metabolic flux through the DXP biosynthesis pathway to overproduce
the isoprenoid, lycopene, in an E. coli strain (EcHW2) that contained
the pAC-LYC plasmid that is necessary for the final steps of lycopene
production. Twenty endogenous genes (dxs, dxr, ispD, ispE, ispG,
ispH, idi, ispA, appY, rpoS, crl, elbA, elbB, yjiD, purH, rnlA, yggT,
ycgZ, ymgA, ariR) documented to increase lycopene yield16,17 were
targeted to tune translation (Fig. 5a). Specifically, for each of the 20
genes, 90-mer oligos containing degenerate ribosome binding site

(RBS) sequences (DDRRRRRDDDD; D 5 A, G, T; R 5 A, G) flanked
by homologous regions on each side were used, with a total pool
complexity of 4.7 3 105 (36 3 25 3 20). The replaced RBS regions
were designed to be more similar to the canonical Shine–Dalgarno
sequence (TAAGGAGGT)18, giving rise to enhanced translation effi-
ciency. Additionally, four genes (ytjC, fdhF, aceE, gdhA) from second-
ary pathways19 were targeted for inactivation by oligos that introduced
two nonsense mutations in the open reading frame, further improving
flux through the DXP pathway. In contrast to prior strategies20–23 that
were experimentally limited by the number of genetic components
that could be manipulated at once, here we optimized 24 genes simul-
taneously to maximize lycopene production.

As many as 15 billion genetic variants (4.3 3 108 bp variations per
cycle for 35 MAGE cycles) were generated. Screening of variants was
done by isolating colonies that produced intense red pigmentation on
Luria–Bertani agar plates. Variants were isolated from ,105 colonies
screened after 5–35 cycles of MAGE (see Supplementary Information),
some exhibiting as much as a fivefold increase in lycopene production
relative to the EcHW2 ancestral strain (Fig. 5b). Under similar experi-
mental conditions, our highest lycopene yield of ,9,000 p.p.m. (mg per
g dry cell weight) is better than documented yields17,19. Sequencing of
six variants (EcHW2a–EcHW2f) revealed RBS convergence towards
consensus-like Shine–Dalgarno sequences in genes localized at the
beginning and end of the biosynthesis pathway (dxs, dxr, idi, ispA) as
well as various gene knockouts from secondary pathways (DytjC,
DgdhA, DfdhF) (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 2).

Different tuning parameters of the lycopene pathway can be indi-
vidually and combinatorially assessed in the isolated variants. For
example, translation optimization of idi alone (EcHW2a) increased
lycopene production by 40%. Whereas optimizing dxs and idi
increased lycopene production by 390% (EcHW2e), additional
optimization at rpoS and dxr, along with inactivation of ytjC,
improved the growth rate of EcHW2f to that of the EcHW1 ancestor.
Interestingly, rpoS is the alternative RNA polymerase subunit sigma
factor sS, the master stress response regulator, and its upregulation
can increase stress resistance to the accumulation of lycopene, a very
hydrophobic molecule17. ytjC is an uncharacterized phosphoglyce-
rate mutase enzyme and is thought to increase metabolic flux
through the DXP pathway by increasing the accumulation of glycer-
aldehyde 3-phosphate intermediates19. Inactivation of glutamate
dehydrogenase (gdhA) increases lycopene production, but causes a
32% decrease in growth rate of EcHW2b relative to wild type.
Combinations of genetic modifications can also be assessed against
each other. For example, an optimized dxs and idi strain (EcHW2e)
produces 12% more lycopene than a strain with dxs and DfdhF
(EcHW2d) and 27% more than a strain with dxs and ispA modifica-
tions (EcHW2c). The optimized DXP biosynthesis pathway pre-
sented here can be used to produce many other isoprenoid
compounds of industrial and pharmaceutical relevance24.

The diversity (that is, the degree of sequence change per target)
generated by MAGE is adjustable and the specificity of targeting is
always high. Oligos with defined sequences produce well-defined
modification, whereas oligos with degenerate sequences produce
high-diversity modifications tailored for exploring a vast sequence
space. In this study, we used well-defined oligos to inactivate protein-
coding sequences and high-diversity degenerate oligos to modify and
sample different RBS sequences. We have also used the MAGE plat-
form to perform whole-genome recoding of E. coli to enhance the
incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins25 and con-
struct safer and multi-virus-resistant strains (F.J.I. et al., manuscript
in preparation). MAGE is thus a complementary technology to de
novo genome synthesis26, allowing the tuning of synthetic and natural
genomes in vivo for various applications.

MAGE is also an accelerated evolution platform that permits the
repeated introduction and maintenance of many neutral (or deleteri-
ous) mutations in the cell population. Although these mutations
would normally disappear in the population via genetic drift or natural
selection, MAGE accelerates the rate of their accumulation in any
individual cell, thus increasing the likelihood of finding sets of muta-
tions that may interact synergistically to produce a surprisingly bene-
ficial phenotype. Using this technology, we could engineer or evolve
cells with higher transfection efficiency (for example, harnessing
natural competence systems27), increased allelic replacement efficiency
(for example, expressing higher levels or mutants28 of the l-Red b
protein) and perform large-scale bacterial artificial chromosome
engineering. The simple allelic replacement mechanism could make
this method amenable for use in other organisms, given that other
ssDNA-binding protein homologues are functional29. Currently,
30 US dollars of commercially synthesized oligos can introduce up
to 27 bp of modification at full degeneracy for a single genomic target.
To target many loci, obtaining oligos from programmable DNA
microchips30 can significantly decrease the cost in comparison to
traditional oligo synthesis. We envision that large-scale pipelines to
program synthetic organisms and ecosystems10 will greatly benefit
from integration of hardware, software and wetware to engineer and
evolve microbial, plant and animal systems.

METHODS SUMMARY
Strains. The EcNR2 strain is MG1655 with l-prophage::bioA/bioB and
cmR::mutS. The EcHW2 strain is MG1655 with l-prophage::bioA/bioB,
kanR::mutS and pAC-LYC plasmid. EcHW2a–f strains were MAGE-cycled
EcHW2 derivatives containing DXP pathway modifications. Details of strains
used are described in Methods.

Allelic replacement. Liquid cell cultures were inoculated from colonies obtained
from a plate and grown at 30 uC to an absorbance (600 nm) of ,0.7
(,7 3 108 cells ml21) in a rotor drum at 200 r.p.m. To induce expression of
the l-Red recombination proteins (Exo, Beta and Gam), cell cultures were
shifted to 42 uC for 15 min and then immediately chilled on ice. In a 4 uC
environment, 1 ml of cells was centrifuged at 16,000g for 30 s. Supernatant
medium was removed and cells were resuspended in dH2O (Gibco catalogue
number 15230). This process was repeated twice with water. Supernatant water
was removed and oligos suspended in water were added to the cell pellet. The
oligos/cells mixture was transferred to a pre-chilled 1 mm gap electroporation
cuvette (Bio-Rad) and electroporated with a Bio-Rad GenePulser electropora-
tion system under the following parameters: 1.8 kV, 200 V and 25 mF. LB-min
medium (1–3 ml) was immediately added to the electroporated cells. The cells
were recovered from electroporation and grown at 30 uC for 2–2.5 h. Once cells
reached mid-logarithmic growth they were used in additional MAGE cycles,
isolated or assayed for genotype and/or phenotype analysis.
Lycopene assay. EcHW2 and derivatives (EcHW2a–f) were quantitatively
assessed for lycopene production after 24 h of growth in LB-min-chlorampheni-
col liquid medium at 30 uC. Lycopene was extracted and quantified at an absor-
bance of 470 nm (see Methods). Lycopene yield was calculated by normalizing
the amount of lycopene extracted to the dry cell weight.

METHODS
Strains and culture conditions. The l prophage was obtained from strain
DY33031, modified to include the bla gene and introduced into wild-type
MG1655 E. coli by P1 transduction at the bioA/bioB gene locus and selected on
ampicillin to yield the strain EcNR1 (l-Red1). Replacement of mutS with the
chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmR cassette) in EcNR1 produced EcNR2
(mutS–, l-Red1). EcNR2 was grown in low salt LB-min medium (10 g tryptone,
5 g yeast extract, 5 g NaCl in 1 l dH2O) for optimal electroporation efficiency. A
premature stop codon was introduced into the cmR gene of EcNR2 with oligo
cat_fwd_stop (Supplementary Table 3) to produce EcFI5, thus inactivating the
cmR gene. An oligo (cat_fwd_restore) containing the wild-type sequence was used
to restore the CmR phenotype. The pAC-LYC plasmid32 containing genes crtE,
crtB and crtI was electroporated into EcNR1 to generate EcHW1, which produces
lycopene at basal levels. Replacement of mutS with a kanamycin resistance gene in
EcHW1 produced EcHW2.
Oligonucleotides and DNA sequencing. All oligonucleotides were obtained from
Integrated DNA Technologies with standard purification. Oligonucleotides used in
the MAGE process contained the following modifications: (1) 30–110 bp in length
for optimization experiments; (2) different numbers of phosphorothioated bases;
and (3) degenerate nucleotides as described elsewhere in this paper. Additional
primers were purchased to amplify relevant genetic regions of the lycopene pathway
to sequence strains that expressed high levels of lycopene. DNA sequencing to
confirm allelic replacements was performed by Agencourt Bioscience.
LacZ and chloramphenicol replacement efficiency assays. Replacement effi-
ciency was characterized by performing the allelic replacement protocol on
EcNR2 cells using 90-mer oligos (Supplementary Table 3) that produced a
premature stop codon in the chromosomal lacZ gene. In general, 250–500 cells
were plated on LB-min containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-b-D-galactoside
and isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (USB Biochemicals) agar plates. Efficiency of
allelic replacement was calculated by taking the ratio of the number of white
colonies to the total number of colonies on plates. A similar strategy was used in
the cmR gene recovery experiments with strain EcFI5 where 30–110mer oligos
were used to determine optimal oligo length for allelic replacement
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). These oligos contained two phosphorothioate bonds
at both the 59 and 39 termini. Cells were plated on LB-min-chloramphenicol and
LB-min agar plates and grown overnight. Efficiency of allelic replacement
was calculated by taking the ratio of the number of colonies on LB-min-
chloramphenicol plates to the number of colonies on LB-min plates.
MAGE automation device. Cells were grown in sterilized 10-ml glass vials placed
in thermally conductive blocks. The growth chambers were climate-regulated
through temperature controllers that actuate Peltier heating/cooling elements.
Cultures acclimatized quickly (,15 s) in chambers held at different tempera-
tures due to small volumes (for example, 3 ml). Aeration of the culture was
achieved through agitation of the chambers at 300 r.p.m. using an orbital shaker.
Real-time monitoring of growth rates was achieved by detecting changes in light
transmittance across the chamber from light-emitting diodes emitting at
600 nm. Cultures were transferred between chambers through solenoid isolation

valves using syringe pumps. Cells were made electrocompetent by a filtration
system, which uses a syringe pump to concentrate cells onto a filter membrane
(0.22 mm pore size) and resuspend them off the membrane with appropriate
electroporation buffer (for example, dH2O). Single-stranded oligos (or PCR
products) were electroporated into cells in a conductive cuvette with an electric
pulse (18 kV cm21). After each cycle, the entire system (chambers, syringes,
filters) was washed with 70% ethanol followed by dH2O three times to reduce
contamination and biofilm formation. All instruments were digitally controlled
through software written in the LabView programming environment (National
Instruments).

Cultures were initially inoculated into 3 ml of medium in the growth chamber.
The device then executed repeatedly and continuously through the following
steps: (1) grow cells at 30 uC to a pre-set density (that is, OD600 nm of 0.7); (2)
induce cells for allelic replacement via 42 uC heat shock for 15 min; (3) chill cells
at 4 uC to halt cellular metabolism; (4) wash cells through 15–20 iterations of
filtration and resuspension with dH2O; (5) mix cell suspension and synthetic
DNA; (6) deliver DNA into cells by electroporation; and (7) resuspend electro-
porated cells with growth media.
Colorimetric screen and assay for lycopene production. Cells from the cycled
EcHW2 population were plated on LB-min-chloramphenicol agar plates and
grown for 1 day at 30 uC and 2 days at room temperature to produce red colonies.
The 24 gene targets were divided into three oligo pools, one containing 10
targets, a second containing 14 targets and a third containing all 24 targets, which
were cycled through the MAGE process in three separate cultures. In total, 105
colonies with increased colour intensity by visual inspection were screened after
cycles 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35. From 127 isolates, six strains (EcHW2a–f, with
representation from each pool) were selected for direct DNA sequencing across
all gene targets and quantitatively measured for lycopene production. For lyco-
pene quantification, these isolated colonies were grown in LB-min medium for
24 h. Lycopene was extracted from 1 ml of cells as follows: centrifuged at 16,000g
for 30 s, removal of supernatant media and resuspended with water, and re-
centrifuged at 16,000g for 30 s. Once the supernatant was removed, the cells were
resuspended in 200 ml acetone and incubated in the dark for 15 min at 55 uC with
intermittent vortexing. The mixture was centrifuged at 16,000g for 30 s and the
supernatant lycopene solution was transferred to a clean tube for quantification.
Absorbance at 470 nm of the extracted lycopene solution was measured using a
spectrophotometer and calibrated against a known lycopene standard (Sigma-
Aldrich, catalogue number L9879) to determine the lycopene content. Dry cell
weight was determined by baking a washed cell pellet at 105 uC for 24 h in the
dark. Lycopene yield of different EcHW2 derivatives (EcHW2a–f) was calculated
by normalizing the amount of lycopene extracted to the dry cell weight.
