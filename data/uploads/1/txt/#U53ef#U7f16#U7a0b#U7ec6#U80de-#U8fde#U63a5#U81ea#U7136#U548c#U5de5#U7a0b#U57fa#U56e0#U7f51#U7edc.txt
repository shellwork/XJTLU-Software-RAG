Novel cellular behaviors and characteristics can be obtained by
coupling engineered gene networks to the cell’s natural regulatory
circuitry through appropriately designed input and output inter-
faces. Here, we demonstrate how an engineered genetic circuit can
be used to construct cells that respond to biological signals in a
predetermined and programmable fashion. We employ a modular
design strategy to create Escherichia coli strains where a genetic
toggle switch is interfaced with: (i) the SOS signaling pathway
responding to DNA damage, and (ii) a transgenic quorum sensing
signaling pathway from Vibrio ﬁscheri. The genetic toggle switch
endows these strains with binary response dynamics and an
epigenetic inheritance that supports a persistent phenotypic alter-
ation in response to transient signals. These features are exploited
to engineer cells that form bioﬁlms in response to DNA-damaging
agents and cells that activate protein synthesis when the cell
population reaches a critical density. Our work represents a step
toward the development of ‘‘plug-and-play’’ genetic circuitry that
can be used to create cells with programmable behaviors.

The engineering of gene regulatory networks is a cornerstone

of synthetic biology (1, 2) and has been instrumental in
elucidating basic principles that govern the dynamics of small
gene networks (3–14) and the origins and consequences of
stochasticity in gene expression (13–18). In addition, gene cir-
cuits designed to perform sophisticated computational tasks,
such as memory storage and logical operations, may support
biotechnological and biomedical applications where they ‘‘pro-
gram’’ cellular behaviors (19–22). However, most networks of
this type are designed to respond to nonendogenous, externally
applied stimuli. To make full use of the customizable computa-
tional capabilities of engineered gene networks in programmable
cells, such networks must be designed to respond to endoge-
nously generated signals and be coupled directly to the regula-
tory circuitry of the cell.

Many cell regulatory systems are organized as modules (23–
25) and a similar design strategy may allow the construction of
cells with desired behaviors and characteristics. We envision that
engineered gene networks can be used as regulatory modules
and interfaced with the cell’s genetic circuitry as ‘‘plug-and-play’’
devices to execute specific programs in response to particular
biological signals. The simplest programmable cell obtained with
this design strategy would be comprised of three distinct modules
(Fig. 1): (i) a signaling pathway (the biosensor module) that
detects relevant signals and interfaces these signals to a regula-
tory circuit, (ii) an artificial genetic module (the regulatory
circuit) capable of responding to the signals transmitted by the
biosensor module, and directing output signals according to its
engineered properties, and (iii) an output interface that converts
the signals transmitted by the regulatory circuit into a biological
response. The behavior of the programmed cell is then deter-
mined by the dynamical and logical properties of the regulatory
module and by the signaling pathways that are used as input and
output interfaces.

The modular structure of a simple programmable cell.

As concrete demonstrations of this modular design strategy,
we have created the four Escherichia coli strains listed in Table
1. In these strains, a genetic toggle switch (4) is interfaced with
two different signaling pathways: (i) the SOS signaling pathway
(strains A1 and A2), which detects single-stranded DNA after
DNA damage (26–28), and (ii) a transgenic quorum sensing
signaling pathway from Vibrio fischeri (29–31) that detects
acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) molecules (strains B1 and B2).
The V. fischeri signaling pathway, which has been exploited to
engineer whole-cell biosensors (32, 33) and cell–cell communi-
cation (5, 10, 34) systems in E. coli, is used to program a strain
(B2) that synthesizes a target protein when the cell population
reaches a critical density. We mainly employ GFP as a quanti-
fiable biological response, but also demonstrate that the design
strategy can be used to control a natural phenotype by creating
a strain (A2) that enters a biofilm-forming state in response to
transient activation of the SOS pathway. Although the engineer-
ing of cellular behavior is not novel, most existing programmed
cells are designed for specific purposes, such as whole-cell
biosensing (35–39), programmed self-destruction (40–43), and
protein synthesis controlled by excess glucolytic flux (44) or cell
density (33, 45). The modular approach that we propose would
facilitate a standardization of genetic circuits that, in analogy to
electronic circuit modules, could be used as general components
in the construction of programmable cells for a variety of
biotechnological and bioengineering applications.

Experimental Procedures
Strains, Plasmids, and Genes. The four strains listed in Table 1 were
obtained by transforming parental E. coli strains (JM 2.300 for
strains A1, B1, and B1) with the indicated plasmids. The A2
strain was obtained by using a modified K-12 parental strain (see
supporting information, which is published on the PNAS web
site). All plasmids were derived from the published pTAK
plasmids (4) and pZ expression vectors (46) by using standard

Fluorescence Measurements. GFP expression was quantified by
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Samples were prepared by
pelleting cells from 1 ml of culture followed by resuspension in
phosphate-buffered saline.

DNA Damage. Cells were grown aerobically in LB medium con-
taining the appropriate antibiotics at 37°C and 300 rpm. Colonies
were picked from selective plates and grown for 17–24 h,
followed by an additional 16 h in medium containing 2 mM
isopropyl-␤-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). DNA damage was
induced with mitomycin C (MMC) or UV irradiation. In the
experiments with MMC treatment, the IPTG-containing culture
was used to inoculate fresh LB medium with different MMC
concentrations and grown for 15 h. The MMC-treated cells were
grown for 3–56 h with dilutions every 12 h to keep the cells in
the logarithmic growth phase. In the experiments with UV
treatment, cells were plated and incubated for 2 h at 30°C before
being exposed to irradiation (Stratalinker 2400) for 1–10 s. Cells
were subsequently collected and grown in fresh medium for 4 h
before being filtered (0.22-␮m Millipore Millex-GV membrane
filter) and assayed.

Biofilm Formation. Cells were grown aerobically in M63 minimal
medium [1.052 g/liter KH2PO4兾5.613 g/liter K2HPO4兾2.0 g/liter
(NH4)2SO4兾0.50 mg FeSO4(H2O)7兾1.0 mmol MgSO4, pH 7.2]
containing 0.2% glucose and appropriate antibiotics at 37°C and
300 rpm. After exposure to MMC or UV irradiation, a small
number of cells were used to inoculate 100-␮l fresh M63 loaded
into 96-well polystyrene plates. The plates were incubated for
24 h before the level of biofilm was quantified by using a crystal
violet staining assay (47). Absorbance at 600 nm was measured
by using a TECAN SPECTRAfluor Plus plate reader. Micro-
fermentor experiments were carried out by using 20-ml contin-
uous-flow fermentors (flow rate, 13 ml兾h), stirred by aeration
with sterile air and containing submerged Corning glass plates as
the substratum for the biofilm. The fermentors were inoculated
with 10 ␮l of culture treated with MMC as described above.
Digital pictures were taken 48 h later.

AHL-Dependent Expression. All experiments involving the strains
B1 and B2 were carried out in LB medium at 30°C unless
otherwise stated. Cells were kept in the logarithmic growth
phase by dilutions at appropriate intervals. AHL used to induce
strain B1 [N-(␤-ketocaproyl)-L-homoserine lactone] was ob-
tained from Sigma. Cells with high and low initial GFP expres-
sion were obtained by growth in medium containing 2 mM IPTG
for 12 h and growth at 42°C for 12 h, respectively. The cells were

subsequently washed and used to inoculate fresh medium. The
density-dependent expression experiment was carried out by
growing the transformed cells on selective plates containing 2
mM IPTG, followed by growth at very low cell densities for 8 h
in LB containing 2 mM IPTG. Cells were subsequently pelleted,
washed three times, and used to inoculate batch cultures at
various initial cell densities. The absorbance (cell density) of the
cultures at 600 nm (A600) was determined with a SPECTRAfluor
Plus plate reader.

Results
Rational Design of Interface Modules. When interfacing an engi-
neered gene network into the genetic circuitry of the cell, the
first step is to achieve an in-depth understanding of the network’s
dynamic properties. In our case, the regulatory circuit (a genetic
toggle switch) is comprised of two genes, lacI and ␭ cI, that
encode the transcriptional regulator proteins, LacR and ␭ CI.
The lacI gene is expressed from a modified PL promoter, PL*,
which is repressed by ␭ CI. The ␭ cI gene is expressed from a
promoter, Ptrc, which is repressed by LacR. This design endows
cells with two distinct phenotypic states (4): one where the ␭CI
activity is high and the expression of lacI is low, and one where
the activity of LacR is high and the expression of ␭ cI is low
(Fig. 2A).

There are two ways perturbations can cause a transition from
one stable expression state to the other: (i) the activity of the
protein that is highly expressed can be decreased, or (ii) the
activity of the protein whose expression is repressed can be
increased. These transitions are illustrated in Fig. 2 A for the
cases where the perturbations cause a transition from the high ␭
CI兾low LacR state to the high LacR兾low ␭CI state. When ␭CI
activity is decreased, lacI expression is derepressed and LacR
activity increases. This represses ␭cI expression, which decreases
␭CI activity and further increases LacR activity. The same result
can be achieved with a perturbation that increases the activity of
LacR. In both cases, a transition from one stable state to the
other occurs if the perturbation is sufficiently large to bring the
system across a certain threshold (see supporting information).
Transitions from one stable state to the other can be induced
by high-amplitude random fluctuations, referred to as noise-
induced transitions (48), or by signals that temporarily change
the parameters of the system. In bistable gene circuits, noise-
induced transitions can cause individual cells to change expres-
sion state at random (49). The result is the emergence of a mixed
population consisting of cells in different expression states,
which appears as a bimodal population distribution when protein
levels are measured in single cells (7, 13, 50).

The genetic toggle switch is a robust bistable system, and
noise-induced transitions are rare (4). In such systems, transi-
tions from one stable state to the other can be induced by a signal

Transitions in the genetic toggle switch. (A) The network has two
stable expression states (indicated by gray boxes) where ␭ CI represses lacI
expression and LacR represses ␭cI expression, respectively. Transition from the
high ␭CI state can be induced by degrading ␭CI or by introducing additional
LacR molecules. (B) Simulated transition induced when the rate of ␭ CI pro-

that temporarily brings the system out of the region of bistability.
A mathematical analysis (see supporting information) indicates
that transitions from the high ␭ CI state to the high LacR state
can be induced by a signal that temporarily increases (i) the ␭CI
decay rate or (ii) the LacR basal synthesis rate. The simulated
response of a single cell to such signals is shown in Fig. 2B. It
illustrates how a cell initially in the high ␭ CI state switches to
the high LacR state as a result of a transient increase in ␭ CI
proteolysis. Increasing the basal LacR synthesis rate gives a
similar response (see supporting information). In both cases, a
transition to the high LacR state occurs when the signal reaches
a threshold value where the high ␭ CI state is destabilized.
Because individual cells have slightly different threshold values,
due, for instance, to variability in plasmid copy number, and
because the probability of a noise-induced transition increases as
the bifurcation parameter approaches the threshold value (48),
it is expected that intermediate signals will give rise to bimodal
population distributions.

Guided by the mathematical analysis, we interfaced the toggle
switch with a natural signaling pathway that increases the rate of
␭ CI decay and an engineered signaling pathway that increases
the rate of LacR synthesis, respectively. The signaling pathway
that degrades ␭ CI in strains A1 and A2 (Table 1) is the
SOS-response pathway, where the RecA coprotease is activated
in the presence of single-stranded DNA (24). Activated RecA
cleaves the ␭ CI repressor protein, causing derepression of the
PL promoter (51). The signaling pathway that increases the basal
expression of the lacI gene in strains B1 and B2 (Table 1) is based
on the quorum sensing pathway V. fischeri (29–31). In this
pathway, the regulator protein of the lux operon, LuxR,
is
induced by AHL, and the induced LuxR protein activates
expression from the lux promoter, PluxI. By placing the lacI gene
downstream of PluxI, the rate of LacR synthesis is increased when
AHL molecules are present in the environment.

␭ cI, and by changing the origin of replication to decrease the
plasmid copy number. This was required to achieve compatibility
between the biosensor module and the regulatory circuit (see
below). As the output interface, we used a medium-copy number
reporter plasmid (pCIRa), carrying a fusion of PL* and the gfp
gene (Fig. 3A).

To evaluate the ability of the modified toggle switch to
respond to activation of the SOS pathway, we quantified GFP
expression in single cells 3–6 h after exposure to various
concentrations of MMC for 15 h. In the absence of MMC, all
cells exhibited little or no GFP expression (Fig. 3B). Nearly all
of the cells expressed GFP after treatment with 500 ng兾ml MMC.
The high and low GFP expression states remained unchanged
after 48 h of additional growth without MMC (see Fig. 3B Insets).
These findings confirm that the two expression states coexist in
the modified toggle switch and that these states are robust
against noise-induced transitions. Bimodal distributions were
observed at intermediate MMC concentrations (Fig. 3B), prob-
ably because of variability in plasmid copy number and the
resultant differences in cellular ␭ CI concentrations giving rise
to variability in induction threshold.

The A1 strain can also detect brief exposures (⬍10 s) to UV
irradiation (Fig. 3C). As in the experiment with MMC, UV
irradiation at intermediate intensities induces a binary cellular
response, resulting in bimodal population distributions. In both
MMC- and UV-treated cells, the feedback architecture of the
toggle switch module prevents expression of the ␭ cI gene, even
after the damaged DNA has been repaired and cells resume their
pretreatment activities (see Fig. 2B). This allows cells to retain
memory of DNA damage over successive generations, as dem-
onstrated by the high expression state ⬎48 h (corresponding to
50–60 generations) after the removal of MMC (see Fig. 3B).

Strain A1: Interfacing the SOS Pathway. Interfacing the genetic
toggle switch (the regulatory circuit) with the SOS network (the
biosensor module) required a series of alterations of the original
pTAK plasmid (4). The toggle switch plasmid (pTSMa, see Fig.
3A) was made by replacing the cI857 gene, which encodes a ␭CI
variant that is cleaved inefficiently by RecA (52), with wild-type

Detecting DNA Damage with Strain A1. Strain A1 is a highly
sensitive sensor of DNA damaging agents. Treatment with 1
ng兾ml and 10 ng兾ml MMC (Fig. 3B) gave a 1.9-fold and 19-fold
increase in the population-averaged fluorescence signal (geo-
metric mean), respectively. For comparison, the two sensor
strains developed by Vollmer et al. (36) showed a 1.8-fold and

Kobayashi et al.

5.0-fold increase in the detected signal in response to 10 ng兾ml
MMC, whereas Kostrzynska et al. (37) reported a minimum
detection limit of 4 ng兾ml MMC (0.012 ␮M). In addition, the
response of the A1 strain to UV irradiation at 6 J兾m2 and 12 J兾m2
was a 44-fold and 250-fold increase in average fluorescence (Fig.
3C). This represents a significant improvement in yield com-
pared to previous reports of 4- to 5-fold increases in signal
intensity at 10 J兾m2 (37, 38).

To evaluate how the architecture of the regulatory circuit
affects the ability of the A1 strain to detect DNA damage, we
tested the response to MMC treatment of a strain that contains
a regulatory circuit identical to the pTSMa toggle switch, except
that it lacks the lacI feedback gene (plasmid pCIE). Fluorescence
could not be detected after 15-h treatments at concentrations
⬍1,000 ng兾ml. A relatively weak fluorescence signal was de-
tected when pCIE兾pCIRa cells were assayed 30–60 min after the
removal of MMC at concentrations between 1,000 and 4,000
ng兾ml. The poor sensitivity and yield are probably due to the
cellular activity of RecA being unable to cleave ␭ CI at a
sufficient rate (see supporting information for further discus-
sion). However, GFP expression could not be detected in cells
assayed 3 h after the removal of MMC. This indicates that the
PL* promoter is active only for a limited time period after DNA
damage in the circuit lacking the lacI gene. Comparing these
results with those obtained from the A1 strain demonstrates that
the feedback architecture of the genetic toggle switch provides
at least a 1,000-fold improvement in sensitivity and enables
readout of a detection event long after the DNA-damaging agent
is removed. The latter could significantly improve the signal-to-
noise ratio, because this feature allows for long signal integra-
tion. The disadvantages of a toggle switch-based biosensor
include a loss of temporal information and a requirement of
resetting, i.e., application of IPTG (4), between detection events.

Strain A2: Permanent Phenotypic Alteration. The above experiments
indicate that the epigenetic inheritance capabilities of the ge-
netic toggle switch might enable a permanent phenotypic change
in response to a transient signal. To demonstrate this feature, we
transferred the control of biofilm formation from the cell’s
natural circuitry to the genetic toggle switch in strain A2. This
was done by deleting the traA gene (53) from the genome of the
host strain and by constructing a biofilm-forming output plasmid
(pBFR) where the expression of the traA gene is controlled by
the PL* promoter. The engineered regulatory circuits of the A2
strain are illustrated in Fig. 4A. In this strain, the traA gene is
constitutively expressed when the cells are in the high LacR兾low
␭ CI state. As a result, the strain is programmed to produce
biofilm only when it has been subjected to DNA damage.

Biofilm formation experiments were carried out by using a
strain that has the traA gene and a strain that lacks the traA gene
as the positive and negative controls, respectively. The level of
biofilm was measured quantitatively by using a crystal violet
microtiter absorbance assay (see Experimental Procedures) for
untreated cells, cells treated with 100 ng兾ml MMC for 15 h, and
cells exposed to 8 J兾m2 UV irradiation before inoculation of the
microplate. The strain lacking the traA gene (the negative
control) and the strain with the traA gene (the positive control)
gave low and high absorbance signals, respectively, regardless of
DNA damage (Fig. 4B). The A2 strain with the toggle switch-
controlled traA gene generated a high signal indicative of biofilm
formation only after exposure to MMC or UV irradiation (Fig.
4B). We confirmed this observation by using microfermentor
experiments (Fig. 4 C and D) where the biofilm formed after
MMC treatment can be detected visually (Fig. 4D). We also
confirmed that prolonged traA expression,
i.e., a persistent
phenotypic alteration, is necessary for biofilm formation. In
separate control experiments, biofilm was only observed if traA
was expressed for ⬎4 h (see supporting information). Such

sustained expression after a brief signal, e.g., a 2-s UV pulse, is
enabled by the memory property of the genetic toggle switch.

Strain B1: Interfacing General Input Signals. The experiments de-
scribed above demonstrate that a natural signaling pathway can
be interfaced with an engineered gene network. However, those
studies exploit a preexisting molecular compatibility: the ␭ CI
protein is naturally cleaved upon the activation of the SOS
pathway. As indicated by the mathematical analysis (supporting
information), a transition between stable expression states in the
genetic toggle switch can also occur if the expression of the
repressed transcription factor protein is increased in response to
an incoming signal. Thus, in principle, any cellular signal that
activates the expression from a bacterial promoter might be used
to couple the genetic toggle switch to natural regulatory circuits.
To demonstrate the generality of the input interface, and the
plug-and-play features of the design strategy, we created a strain
(B1) where a biosensor of AHL molecules interacts with the
genetic toggle switch via the lacI gene. The engineered regula-
tory circuitry in the B1 strain (Fig. 5A) consists of a low-copy
number AHL sensor plasmid (pAHLa), carrying a fusion of the
lacI gene and the luxR-PluxI fragment from the V. fischeri lux
operon, and a medium-copy number toggle switch plasmid
(pTSMb1). In this strain, the toggle switch plasmid carries a copy
of the gfp gene, such that cells fluoresce in the high ␭ CI兾low
LacR state.

The architecture of the regulatory circuitry in strain B1 (Fig.
5A) means that GFP expression should be activated by transient
treatment with IPTG and deactivated by transient exposure to
AHL. Fig. 5B shows the result of repeated treatments with IPTG
or AHL for 12 h followed by a 12-h period (corresponding to
12–15 generations) where the inducing signals were absent. Over
a 72-h time period, the cells were successfully switched back and
forth between expression states three times, confirming that the
engineered circuits remain functional over many cell genera-
tions. The partial decrease in fluorescence observed 12 h after
removal of IPTG (Fig. 5B) reflects the relaxation from a state
where LacR is completely inactive to a stable state where ␭ CI
is the dominant repressor, but LacR still has some basal activity.

is partially induced (bimodal response, see Inset) at intermediate AHL con-

The stability of the distinct expression states was confirmed in a
separate control experiment where stable expression was ob-
served for up to 50 h (corresponding to 50–60 generations) after
the removal of the inducing factor (see supporting information).
To evaluate the switching dynamics and the sensitivity of the
B1 strain, we conducted a series of experiments where cells
initially in the high or low GFP expression states were exposed
to AHL at various concentrations for 24 h (Fig. 5C). Regardless
of the concentration of AHL, cells that were initially in the high
LacR state (low GFP expression, open circles in Fig. 5C)
remained in this state. Cells initially in the high ␭CI state (high
GFP expression, closed circles in Fig. 5C) remained in that state
at AHL concentrations ⬍20 nM. All cells switched to the low
GFP state when treated with AHL at 50 nM concentration or
higher. Bimodal population distributions (Fig. 5C Inset) were
observed at AHL concentrations between 20 and 50 nM. It is
clear from Fig. 5 B and C that the long-term stability of the two
expression states and the switching properties of the A1 strain
(see Fig. 3B) are preserved in the B1 strain.

Strain B2: Density-Dependent Gene Activation. AHL is a natural
biological signal secreted by Gram-negative bacteria as a means
of coordinating cellular activity with the cell population density
(29–31). To enable the E. coli population to measure its own
density through AHL, we created the plasmid pAHLb where the
luxI gene from V. fischeri is expressed polycistronically with the
luxR gene and lacI is expressed from the PluxI promoter (Fig. 6A).
The protein encoded by luxI is a synthetase that converts
common precursor metabolites into AHL signaling molecules
(29–31), and the extracellular concentration of AHL correlates

with the cell density in cultures of cells that carry the luxI gene.
As a result, LuxR should be activated, and lacI expression from
the pAHLb plasmid increased, when the cell density increases.
To construct a strain where the expression of a target gene is
induced at a critical cell density, we cotransformed three dif-
ferent plasmids to create the B2 strain (Table 1): the low-copy
pAHLb plasmid regulating lacI expression, the medium-copy
toggle switch plasmid pTSMb2, and the high-copy reporter
plasmid pCIRb (Fig. 6A). A strain lacking the luxI gene (plasmid
pAHLa) was used as a negative control. To evaluate the depen-
dence of GFP expression on cell density, we inoculated cultures
with different numbers of cells, and assayed them after 14 h of
growth. In cultures with low or high densities (A600 ⫽ 0.06 and
A600 ⫽ 0.56), all cells were observed to express GFP at very low
or very high levels, respectively (Fig. 6B). At intermediate cell
densities (A600 ⫽ 0.10 and A600 ⫽ 0.22), the population distri-
bution contains two peaks (i.e., a bimodal response). Negative
control experiments showed that GFP synthesis remained re-
pressed at all densities in cultures of cells lacking the luxI gene
(Fig. 6C). The high GFP expression observed in Fig. 6B can thus
be attributed to the engineered circuit sensing that the cell
population has reached a critical density. Experiments where
cultures were inoculated with equal numbers of cells but incu-
bated for different time periods gave similar results (data not
shown).

Because of the modular design of this system, density-
dependent synthesis of any protein can be achieved simply by
replacing the gfp gene on the high-copy number reporter plasmid
with a gene of interest. For example, programmed population
control could be achieved by replacing gfp with a killer gene, as
it was recently shown (34), by fusing the ccdB gene to the PluxI
promoter and synthesizing LuxR and LuxI constitutively inside
E. coli cells. Moreover, the sharp switching threshold of our
system might be useful in industrial-scale production of proteins

that inhibit cell growth because the target protein is synthesized
only when the population has reached a high density.

Discussion
This study has demonstrated how programmable cells can be
constructed by designing appropriate interfaces that couple
engineered gene networks to the regulatory circuitry of the cell.
An engineered genetic toggle switch (4) was used as a signal
processing circuit to construct strains with binary switching
responses and persistent changes in gene expression patterns to
biological signals. The memory capability of the toggle switch,
which allows cells to indefinitely store a record of a detection
event for later interrogation, was exploited to ‘‘program’’ a strain
with a specific phenotypic response (i.e., biofilm formation). We
also constructed a strain where the expression of a target gene
is controlled in a binary on兾off fashion when the cell density
reaches a critical value. In this strain, it is the sharp switching
dynamics of the genetic toggle switch, rather than its epigenetic
memory, that is important for the desired cell function. Our work
shows that programmable cells can be assembled by using a
modular design strategy, paving the way for the development of
‘‘plug-and-play’’ genetic circuit devices.

Our investigations also revealed some of the current chal-
lenges in constructing artificial gene circuits with sophisticated
dynamical and computational properties. Interfacing these cir-
cuits with natural signaling pathways (or with each other)
requires that the signals (e.g., activating or repressing transcrip-
tion factors) are appropriately adjusted to allow effective infor-
mation transmission between circuit modules while, at the same
time, maintaining the proper function of the system as a whole.
In many cases, the properties of the system must be optimized
rather than those of the individual components (see supplemen-
tal information). In this respect, the modular design strategy
could benefit significantly from the development of directed
evolution technologies (54, 55) that can select for nontrivial
dynamical behaviors. Moreover, more complex gene regulatory
modules and interfaces need to be constructed to fully realize the
capabilities of modular genetic control circuits. This could
enable sophisticated processing capabilities,
including event
counting and signal integration.
