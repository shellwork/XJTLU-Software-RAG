Synthetic biology has advanced the design of standardized control
devices that program cellular functions and metabolic activities in
living organisms1. Rational interconnection of these synthetic
switches resulted in increasingly complex designer networks that
execute input-triggered genetic instructions with precision,
robustness and computational
logic reminiscent of electronic
circuits2,3. Using trigger-controlled transcription factors, which
independently control gene expression4,5, and RNA-binding
proteins that inhibit the translation of transcripts harbouring
specific RNA target motifs6,7, we have designed a set of synthetic
transcription–translation control devices that could be rewired in a
plug-and-play manner. Here we show that these combinatorial
circuits integrated a two-molecule input and performed digital
computations with NOT, AND, NAND and N-IMPLY expression
logic in single mammalian cells. Functional interconnection of two
N-IMPLY variants resulted in bitwise intracellular XOR operations,
and a combinatorial arrangement of three logic gates enabled
independent cells to perform programmable half-subtractor and
half-adder calculations. Individual mammalian cells capable of
executing basic molecular arithmetic functions isolated or coordi-
nated to metabolic activities in a predictable, precise and robust
manner may provide new treatment strategies and bio-electronic
interfaces in future gene-based and cell-based therapies.

Today’s electronic devices are controlled by binary calculations
executed by electrons flowing through metal wires that are inter-
connected as multi-layered logic gates. Similarly, natural and synthetic
gene circuits can be encoded and chemically rewired to integrate
environmental and cellular signals and perform logic metabolic com-
putations controlling physiological activities2,3,8–10. With its defining
modular design and standardization principles1, synthetic biology
has significantly advanced the construction of genetic circuit com-
ponents that control transcription or translation in a trigger-inducible
manner11–13. The standardized and modular design of these gene
switches improved compatibility for the ‘plug-and-play’ construction
of higher-order networks that
function in bacterial, yeast and
mammalian cells after minor refinements12. Examples of synthetic
networks with similar circuit topology in different species include logic
gates2,3,9,14,15, molecular counters8, molecular timing devices16, syn-
thetic eco-sensing and quorum-sensing/hormone systems17,18, band-
pass filters19,20 and different types of oscillator that program rhythmic
transgene expression with tunable frequency and amplitude21,22.

Many of the transcription-control devices used share a common
two-component design: a synthetic transcription factor containing a
trigger-controlled DNA-binding motif fused to a transactivation
domain binds to a specific operator, thereby activating adjacent minimal
promoters in an adjustable manner12. For example, the antibiotic
erythromycin fine-tunes the induction of the synthetic promoter
PETR2 by the erythromycin-dependent transactivator (ET1)5, and the
apple metabolite phloretin modulates the activation of the chimeric
promoter PTtgR1 by the phloretin-dependent transactivator (TtgA1)4
(Fig. 1). RNA controllers are proteins or nucleic acids that vary trans-
lation when binding to complementary natural or synthetic RNA
motifs engineered into transcripts6,7,23. For example, the bacteriophage

MS2 coat protein (MS2) binds to the MS2box RNA motif (MS2box)6,
and the archaeal ribosomal protein L7Ae interacts with its cognate
C/Dbox RNA structure (C/Dbox)7,24 (Fig. 1). These transcription- and
translation-control components were wired into the following genetic
switchboard: input molecules (erythromycin or phloretin) abolish the
binding of the transcription factors (ET1 or TtgA1), which otherwise
transactivate their cognate promoters (PETR2 or PTtgR1) and drive
expression of the RNA-binding protein (MS2 or L7Ae) or a transcript
encoding the protein-specific RNA box (MS2box or C/Dbox) and the
destabilized fluorescent reporter gene (encoding d2EYFP or dsRed)
(Fig. 1). Both transcription units are functionally connected by the
RNA-binding proteins (MS2 or L7Ae) which inhibit the translation
of transcripts containing the cognate RNA boxes (MS2box or C/Dbox)
(Fig. 1). Combinatorial assembly and permutation of the controller
components in this genetic switchboard enabled the design of distinct
computational circuits containing up to six different expression units
and performing specific digital logic operations. Each of the Boolean
circuits integrates a two-molecule input into a digital ON/OFF expres-
sion decision, following the processing logic of NOT, NAND and
N-IMPLY gates (Fig. 2; see Supplementary Fig. 1 for control experi-
ments showing component leakiness and threshold-defining settings
for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)). The N-IMPLY circuits,
which are exclusively induced in the presence of only one specific input
molecule, were wired in two different formats. The first was an
A ANDNOT B circuitry,
in which the translation of a phloretin-
controlled TtgA1-mediated PTtgR1-driven d2EYFP transcript contain-
ing a C/Dbox in its 59 untranslated region (59 UTR) could be inhibited
by erythromycin-controlled ET1-mediated PETR2-driven expression of
the C/Dbox-binding protein L7Ae (Fig. 2a). The second format was a

otherwise induce promoters (PTF1 and PTF2) that drive the transcription of
expression units either encoding an RNA-binding protein (box ligand) or

with its target box inhibits reporter gene translation. Sequential wiring of the

mediated PETR2-driven d2EYFP transcript containing a MS2box in its
59 UTR could be inhibited by phloretin-controlled PTtgR1-driven

of the system-encoding vectors into human embryonic kidney cells
(HEK-293), fluorescent reporter gene expression was digitally con-
trolled and exclusively

As indicated by the consistency of fluorescence microscopy and FACS-
mediated single-cell analysis, the cellular N-IMPLY computations
executed by the interconnected transcription/translation controllers
were remarkably robust (Fig. 2a, b). Detailed control experiments
confirmed that the inducer molecules did not influence cell viability4,5
and showed that they had no effect on constitutive d2EYFP or dsRed
expression levels at repressing concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).
Furthermore, there was no relevant interference between the RNA-
controlling modules, which ensures high specificity of the engineered
N-IMPLY gates (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).

networks with complex computation logic we chose to engineer the
XOR gate. XOR computations are particularly challenging to design
because they integrate two different input signals and produce the
output ON exclusively if one of the inputs is ON (Fig. 3a). Because
of this complexity, XORs have so far only been constructed in non-
cellular deoxyribozyme-based circuits25 and as intercellular crosstalk
in bacteria3 and yeast2. Engineering HEK-293 cells with all components
of both N-IMPLY gates (A ANDNOT B as well as B ANDNOT A)
encoded on six different plasmids human cells produced d2EYFP with
digital XOR expression logic after the addition of different combina-
tions of the trigger-molecules erythromycin and phloretin (Fig. 3b, c).
Although both d2EYFP expression units are completely transactivated
by their respective transcription factors in the absence of input signals,
the RNA controllers were able to inhibit translation efficiently and
prevent d2EYFP expression (Fig. 3c). As required, the output of the
XOR gate was also repressed in the presence of both input signals when
both transcription factors were inactivated and also when neither of
the two d2EYFP expression units was expressed. However, addition
of either erythromycin or phloretin resulted in inactivation of the

corresponding transcription factor, whereas its counterpart remained
active and induced its respective d2EYFP expression unit (Fig. 3c). For
rigorous analysis of network dynamics and the contribution of indi-
vidual system components to the computation behaviour we decom-
posed the XOR circuit by sequentially removing individual components;
this resulted in distinct circuits that performed specific logic computa-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 4). Taking away either of the reporter genes
resulted in N-IMPLY gates (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b), elimination of
either transcription factor generated two distinct NOT gates (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4c, d), and removal of either translation inhibitor
produced two different gates with NAND logic (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f).
These results underline the rational and predictable plug-and-play
characteristic of the transcription/translation-control components
and show that these individual components can be readily rewired into
combinatorial structures to perform biocomputing activities ranging
from simple NOT gates to complex XOR gates.

As a next step towards programmable single-cell biocomputers we
added another layer of computation capacity to the XOR gate to design
a half-subtractor, which is commonly used in digital electronics as a

binary arithmetic circuit capable of performing a subtraction of two
bits. The half-subtractor was designed by combination of the XOR
gate, which calculates the difference D, and an N-IMPLY gate to
calculate the borrow C (Fig. 4a). The additional N-IMPLY gate
(A ANDNOT B) was constructed by replacing the yellow fluorescent
reporter gene of the aforementioned A ANDNOT B gate with dsRed so
that its modified phloretin-regulated and L7Ae-controlled reporter
unit would produce a red fluorescent output (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
When placing this seven-component multi-processing device into
human cells it performed precise two-input–two-output integration,
showing half-subtractor calculation characteristics as predicted
(Fig. 4b, c). Despite its high complexity, the half-subtractor perform-
ance was robust as indicated by the correlation of fluorescence micro-
scopy and FACS analysis (Fig. 4c). In addition, in the presence of
erythromycin, which programmed the half-subtractor to express both
reporter genes, yellow and red fluorescence micrographs show almost
perfect correlation, which suggests that the observed processing beha-
viour did indeed result from single-cell computations (Fig. 4c).

Besides the half-subtractor, the half-adder, which calculates the
addition of two bits, is the second (bio)computer unit providing
fundamental arithmetic operations. Together they manage any cal-
culation in digital electronics. The design of a genetically encoded
half-adder requires the combination of an XOR gate and an AND gate
(Fig. 4a). The AND gate consists of a dsRed expression unit whose
transcripts contain both MS2box and C/Dbox RNA motifs in their
59 UTR. They block the translation of dsRed on binding to MS2 or
L7Ae, respectively. When MS2 transcription is set for repression by
phloretin and L7Ae production is controlled in an erythromycin-
repressible manner, pSA117-encoded dsRed is only expressed in the
presence of both phloretin and erythromycin (Supplementary Fig. 5c).
The pSA117-derived control vector lacking any RNA motifs showed
constitutive dsRed expression (Supplementary Fig. 5d). Combination
of this AND gate, which determines the carry C, with the aforemen-
tioned XOR gate (Fig. 3) calculating the sum S resulted in robust
half-adder-specific computations in individual cells that can be pro-
grammed by a distinct set of input signals (Fig. 4d, e). Quantitative
fluorescence profiling of entire circuit-transfected populations using
a plate reader showed mean induction factors (OFF/ON) of 12
(d2EYFP) and 13 (dsRed) for the half-subtractor (Supplementary
Figs 6a and 7a) and 14 (d2EYFP) and 4 (dsRed) for the half-adder
(Supplementary Figs 6b and 7b). Furthermore, time-lapse fluorescence
microscopy of entire circuit-transfected populations confirmed half-
subtractor and half-adder processing dynamics in real time (Sup-
plementary Movies 1 and 2).

In digital electronics the presence or absence of electrons represents
the unique input signals, which allows multi-bit processing in a
switchboard of multi-layered logic gates performing distinct calcula-
tions. The flow of electrons through the switchboard can be programmed
to process desired algorithms. Although the design of electronic com-
puters has achieved enormous processing power, living mammalian
cells are in principle no less powerful, because they constantly process
logic operations and perform countless physiological computations in
parallel to coordinate endogenous metabolites and interface with
environmental signals26. Single-cell biocomputers are therefore com-
patible with any physiological trigger input that increases parallel
processing power; they may be genetically programmed to execute
encoded activities; they are scalable to tissue structures; and they
are straightforward to interface with host metabolism to achieve
therapeutic impact. Examples of synthetic biocomputing devices that
sense signal input and process a coordinated therapeutic output such as
sophisticated cancer kill switches integrating multi-input transforma-
tion signals10,11,27 were first tested in cell cultures, but pioneering
one-input widgets such as T-cell population controllers28, artificial
insemination devices29, blue-light-triggered glucose homeostasis for
diabetes therapy13 and prosthetic gouty arthritis networks for the
treatment of hyperuricemic disorders30 have been used successfully

to perform therapeutic calculations when implanted and plugged into
the metabolism of animals.

Programming single mammalian cells to perform multi-bit proces-
sing has been extremely challenging because the computations must
operate in functional isolation from the cellular metabolism. Complex
multi-bit processing devices have therefore been engineered in which
individual processing components are encoded in single bacterial3
or yeast2 cells, which communicate through chemical wires to perform
computations in multicellular assemblies. We have successfully
merged transcription and translation controllers in a combinatorial
plug-and-play manner
ranging
from simple logic gates to complex XOR controllers as well as half-
subtractors and half-adders executing fundamental arithmetic opera-
tions. Mammalian cells engineered with programmable genetic
devices performing arithmetic calculations with similar precision,
robustness and predictability to those of their digital electronics
counterparts may enable the assembly of tissue-like biocomputers that
could allow the design of complex human–machine interfaces and
provide diagnostic information and therapeutic interventions in future
gene-based and cell-based treatment strategies.

METHODS SUMMARY
Biocomputer design. Construction details for expression vectors are provided in
Supplementary Information and Supplementary Table 1. HEK-293T cells
(American Type Culture Collection, CRL-11268) were cultivated at 37 uC in
DMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (lot no. PE01026P;
Bioconcept) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells were (co)-transfected
with biocomputer-encoding plasmids (Supplementary Table 2) by using a
polyethyleneimine-based protocol. At 6 h after transfection, the cells were
re-seeded into 96-well plates containing erythromycin (2.7 mM; stock solution:
5 mg ml21 in 100% ethanol; Sigma Aldrich) and phloretin (50 mM; stock solution:
14.5 mM in 100% ethanol; Sigma Aldrich) as indicated and cultivated for a further
62 h before analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Flow cytometry. Cell populations were analysed with a LSRII Fortessa flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) equipped for d2EYFP (488-nm laser, 505-nm
longpass filter and 530/30 emission filter (passband centred on 530 nm; passband
width 30 nm)) and dsRed (561 nm laser, 505-nm longpass filter and 586/15
emission filter) detection and set to exclude dead cells and cell doublets. Each
sample was spiked with AlignFlow alignment beads (A-7302; Life Technologies) as
internal control, ensuring consistency of flow cytometry settings among different
circuits and independent experiments (Supplementary Fig. 9). At least 10,000 cells
were recorded per data set and analysed with FACSDiva (version no. 6.1.3; BD
Biosciences). To score digital expression profiles of the biocomputer devices,
transfected HEK-293 populations were gated for cells with high d2EYFP/yellow
or dsRed/red expression/fluorescence levels beyond a threshold of 104 arbitrary
fluorescence units (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for control and FACS threshold-
defining experiments and Supplementary Fig. 10 for raw data on circuit perform-
ance). The percentage of gated cells was multiplied by their median fluorescence,
resulting in a weighted d2EYFP/dsRed expression value that correlated fluor-
escence intensity with cell number.

RESEARCH LETTER

transactivator

METHODS
Biocomputer components. Comprehensive design and construction details for
all expression vectors are provided in Supplementary Table 1. Key plasmids
include the following. pWW35 (ref. 5) encodes constitutive expression of the
(ET1; PSV40-ET1-pA). pMG11 (ref. 4)
macrolide-dependent
harbours a constitutive expression unit encoding the phloretin-dependent trans-
activator (TtgA1; PSV40-TtgA1-pA). pSA83 encodes a phloretin-responsive TtgA1-
triggered PTtgR1-driven d2EYFP expression unit harbouring a C/Dbox in the
59 UTR that is targeted by the translation suppressor protein L7Ae24 (PTtgR1-C/
Dbox-d2EYFP-pA; GenBank ID JQ624673). pSA89 encodes an erythromycin-
responsive ET1-triggered PETR2-driven d2EYFP expression unit harbouring a
MS2box in the 59 UTR that is targeted by the translation suppressor protein
MS2 (ref. 6) (PETR2-MS2box-d2EYFP-pA; GenBank ID JQ624674). pSA91 encodes
an erythromycin-responsive ET1-triggered PETR2-driven L7Ae expression unit
(PETR2-L7Ae-pA; GenBank ID JQ624675). pSA95 encodes a phloretin-responsive
TtgA1-triggered MS2 expression unit (PTtgR1-MS2-pA; GenBank ID JQ624676).
pSA108 encodes a phloretin-responsive TtgA1-triggered PTtgR1-driven dsRed
expression unit harbouring a C/Dbox in the 59 UTR that is targeted by the trans-
lation suppressor protein L7Ae24 (PTtgR1-C/Dbox-dsRed-pA). pSA117 encodes a
constitutive PhCMV-driven dsRed expression unit harbouring both MS2box and
C/Dbox RNA motifs in its 59 UTR that are targeted by the translation suppressor
proteins MS2 (ref. 6) and L7Ae24, respectively (PhCMV-MS2box-C/Dbox-dsRed-
pA). The plasmid composition of each circuit is provided in Supplementary
Table 2.
Cell culture, transfection and gene regulation. HEK-293T cells (American Type
Culture Collection, CRL-11268) were cultivated at 37 uC in DMEM medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (lot no. PE01026P; Bioconcept) and
1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells were (co)-transfected using an optimized
polyethyleneimine-based protocol. In brief, a transfection solution containing
4 mg of plasmid DNA mixtures, 800 ml of FCS-free DMEM and 12 ml of polyethy-
leneimine (1 mg ml21 in water; Polysciences) was incubated for 30 min at 22 uC
before it was added dropwise to 4 3 105 HEK-293 cells seeded in each well of a six-
well plate 14 h before transfection (see Supplementary Table 2 for a detailed
composition of plasmid DNA mixtures). At 6 h after transfection, the cells were
detached for 1 min using 200 ml of trypsin/EDTA (Biowest), washed once in 1 ml

of FCS-containing DMEM, resuspended in 0.75 ml of FCS-containing DMEM,
re-seeded into 12 wells of a 96-well plate containing the trigger molecules
erythromycin (2.7 mM; stock solution: 5 mg ml21 in 100% ethanol; Sigma
Aldrich) and phloretin (50 mM; stock solution: 14.5 mM in 100% ethanol;
Sigma Aldrich) as indicated and cultivated for a further 62 h before analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 8).
Fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence and time-lapse microscopy was performed
with an inverted fluorescence microscope (DMI 6000B; Leica Microsystems)
equipped with an incubation chamber, a DFC350FX R2 digital camera (Leica),
a 103 objective (objective HC PL FL 103/0.30 PH1 –/D 11.0; Leica), a 495/535-
nm (d2EYFP) and 580/630-nm (dsRed) excitation/emission filter set and LAS AF
imaging software (FW4000-TZ; Leica). Identical settings including exposure times
of 1 s for d2EYFP and dsRed were used for all fluorescence micrographs.
Flow cytometry. All engineered cell populations were analysed with a Becton
Dickinson LSRII Fortessa flow cytometer equipped for d2EYFP (488 nm laser,
505 nm longpass filter, 530/30 emission filter (passband centred on 530 nm;
passband width 30 nm)) and dsRed (561 nm laser, 505 longpass filter and
586/15 emission filter) detection and set to exclude dead cells and cell doublets.
Before analysis, each sample was spiked with AlignFlow alignment beads (A-7302;
Life Technologies), serving as an internal control and ensuring consistency of flow
cytometry settings between different circuits and independent experiments
(Supplementary Fig. 9). At least 10,000 cells were recorded in each data set and
analysed with BD FACSDiva (version no. 6.1.3; BD Biosciences). To score digital
expression profiles of the biocomputer devices, transfected HEK-293 cell popula-
tions were gated for cells with high d2EYFP/yellow or dsRed/red expression/
fluorescence levels beyond a threshold of 104 arbitrary fluorescence units
(see Supplementary Fig. 1 for control and FACS threshold-defining experiments
and Supplementary Fig. 10 for raw data on circuit performance). The percentage of
gated cells was multiplied by their median fluorescence, resulting in a weighted
d2EYFP/dsRed expression value that correlated fluorescence intensity with cell
number.
Plate-reader-based fluorescence analysis. Fluorescence of entire circuit-
transfected cell populations was profiled with a monochromatic Tecan Infinite
200pro plate reader with excitation and emission set to 488/9 nm and 535/20 nm
for d2EYFP, and 560/9 nm and 595/20 nm for dsRed, respectively. Autofluorescence
of mock-transfected cells was deducted from circuit-derived fluorescence.
