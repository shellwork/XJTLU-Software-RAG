ABSTRACT
Synthetic biology is interpreted as the engineering-driven building of 
increasingly  complex  biological  entities  for  novel  applications. En-
couraged  by  progress  in  the  design  of  artificial  gene  networks,  de 
novo DNA synthesis and protein engineering, we review the case for
this  emerging  discipline.  Key  aspects  of  an  engineering  approach 
are  purpose-orientation,  deep  insight  into  the  underlying  scientific 
principles,  a  hierarchy  of  abstraction  including  suitable  interfaces 
between and within the levels of the hierarchy, standardization, and 
the  separation  of  design  and  fabrication.  Synthetic  biology  investi-
gates possibilities to implement these requirements into the process 
of  engineering  biological  systems.  This  is  illustrated  on  the  DNA 
level  by  the  implementation  of  engineering-inspired  artificial  opera-
tions  such  as  toggle  switching,  oscillating,  or  production  of  spatial 
patterns. On the protein level, the functionally self-contained domain 
structure  of  a  number  of  proteins  suggests  possibilities  for  essen-
tially  Lego-like  recombination  which can  be  exploited  for  repro-
gramming  DNA  binding  domain  specificities  or  signaling  pathways. 
Alternatively, computational design emerges to rationally reprogram 
enzyme  function.  Finally,  the  increasing facility of  de  novo  DNA 
synthesis - synthetic biology’s system fabrication process - supplies
the  possibility  to  implement  novel  designs  for  ever  more  complex 
systems.  Some  of  these  elements  have  merged  to  realize  the  first 
tangible  synthetic  biology  applications  in  the  area  of  manufacturing 
of pharmaceutical compounds.

INTRODUCTION 

The advent of systems biology, the steady development of founda-
tional  technologies  such  as  de  novo  DNA  synthesis  (Tian,  et  al., 
2004), milestone experiments such as the computational re-design 
of  enzymes  (Dwyer,  et  al.,  2004),  the  opportunity  to  widely  re-
combine  zinc  fingers  to  re-program  DNA-binding  site  specificity 
(Dreier,  2001)  and  the  availability  of  well-studied  model  regula-
tory  systems  for  the  design  of  engineering-inspired  molecular  de-
vices provide a very powerful knowledge and technology basis for 
building  novel  biological  entities.  Encouraging  applications  come 
from  such  diverse  areas  as  the  design  of  artificial  gene  networks 
(Sprinzak  and  Elowitz,  2005),  the  refactoring  of  small  genomes 
(Chan,  et  al.,  2005),  the  reprogramming  of  signaling  pathways
(Dueber,  et  al.,  2003),  or  metabolic  engineering  (Martin,  et  al., 
2003)  and  have  been  referred  to  as  “synthetic  biology”.  These 
examples  entertain  the  notion  that  adaptation  and  assembly  of 
functionally self-contained parts such as promoters, ribosome bind-

ing  sites,  coding  sequences,  terminators,  or  protein  domains  is  a
promising  way  to  re-constitute  existing  or  to  produce  novel,  bio-
logical entities. To extend such an approach to the many opportu-
nities  typically  associated  with  the  application  of  biological  sys-
tems, we need to establish a number of rules. Building novel parts, 
devices,  and  in  particular  complex  systems  will  require  a  system-
atic  approach  that  relies  on  modularity  and  abstraction  at  various 
cellular  levels  in  order  to  be  useful  to  a  broad  group  of  biotech-
nologists. It will also require a technology to fabricate the designs, 
more precisely the DNA encoding the system. This is synonymous 
to  following  an  engineering  approach,  even  if  biology  is  in  many 
aspects  not  understood  well  enough  to  consider  it  a  sufficient
knowledge base for an engineering discipline. 

This  review  will  discuss  prominent  works  that  have  helped 
launch this engineering vision and will attempt – in one review – to 
touch  upon  all  the  fields  that  we  perceive  as  the  currently  most 
relevant  to synthetic  biology, spanning  the  entire  trajectory  from 
fabrication  via  design  to  applications on  protein,  gene  networks, 
and  systems  level.  Several  separate aspects  of  these  fields  have 
recently  been  reviewed  (e.g.  (Andrianantoandro,  et  al.,  2006; 
Benner and Sismour, 2005; Endy, 2005; Forster and Church, 2006; 
Hasty, et al., 2002; Kærn, et al., 2003; McDaniel and Weiss, 2005; 
Sprinzak and Elowitz, 2005). However, we reason that it is impor-
tant  to  cover  all  major  aspects  of  the  engineering  vision  in  one 
review  to  give  emphasis  to  synthetic  biology’s  rather  comprehen-
sive  claim  of  re-organizing  the  bioengineering  endeavor. After  a 
brief discussion on the fundamental characteristics of an engineer-
ing  approach,  we  bring  together  prominent  examples  from  these 
aspects  and  finally  discuss  the  requirements  and  implications for 
bioinformatics.

TOWARDS ENGINEERING OF BIOLOGY

Engineers’ efforts in the field of engineering biology are furnished 
with only a few success stories. This reflects the fact that the abil-
ity to engineer biology in a directed and successful manner is still 
rather limited today and as a consequence, the complexity of things 
we can efficiently make is still quite small. Synthetic biology with 
its engineering  vision  aims  to  overcome  the  existing  fundamental 
inabilities in system design and system  fabrication, by developing 
foundational  principles  and  technologies  to  ultimately  enable  a 
systematic forward-engineering of (parts of) biological systems for 
improved and novel applications (Fig. 1). Conceptually, this needs 
to  encompass  several  characteristic  features  of  other  established 
engineering disciplines (Endy, 2005):

[i] In non-biology related areas, engineers can usually draw on a 
sound  knowledge  base.  In-depth  understanding  (sometimes  down 
to the first principles) permits computer-based design of new sys-

tems  by  going  through  iterations  between  computer  models  and 
simulations. This allows  an  extensive  in  silico  testing  of  new  de-
sign variants. 

[ii] The application of abstraction hierarchies is a common char-
acteristic in almost every engineering endeavor and results in sev-
eral practical advantages. First, the introduction of system bounda-
ries basically hides information and is thus a way to manage com-
plexity. In other words, abstraction is useful as it allows individu-
als  to  work  independently  at  each  level  of  the  hierarchy.  It  is  an 
organizational  prerequisite  for  combining  parts  into  complex  sys-
tems.

[iii]  In  order  to  guarantee  “plug-and-play”  compatibility  of  dif-
ferent  components  in  an  abstraction  hierarchy,  the  connections 
between the different parts need to be defined, i.e. standardization 
is  required.  Only  broadly  implemented  standards  for  the  compo-
nents themselves and their in- and output criteria would ensure that 
interfaces  between  components  fit,  even  when  they  are  designed 
and  fabricated  by  different  laboratories  or,  ultimately,  different 
companies.

[iv] Finally,  another  characteristic  feature  of  “true”  engineering 
is the decoupling of the design process from the actual fabrication 
of components or systems. Both tasks require a distinct set of skills 
and  expertise,  which  is  typically  not  provided  by  the  same  indi-
viduals.  However,  as  a  consequence  this  requires  that  the  design 
engineers  also  need to have  a  sound  knowledge  about  how  things 
are actually produced and how parts are assembled. In other words, 
the design for an object is useless if it has been designed in such a 
way that no possibility exists to fabricate it.

We argue that design in biology along these engineering charac-
teristics is  a  realistic  goal, to  a  sufficiently  promising  extent, for 
the following reasons:

[i]  There  is  a  ubiquitous  tendency  to  move  from  qualitative  to 
quantitative  analyses  in  biological  sciences.  This  starts  to  provide 
on  a  large  scale  the  data  sets  that  are  needed  to  understand  and 
structure  biological  complexity,  for  example  by  means  of  mathe-
matical  models. Even  if  the  complexity  we  can  manage  does  not 
currently  go  much  beyond  small  artificial  gene  networks,  whose 
DNA-basis  can  be  designed  relatively  independently  from  the  re-
maining  cellular  environment,  our  ever  increasing  knowledge  and 
system  understanding  will  allow  us  to  extend our  realm  of  design 
further and further.

[ii] The introduction of system boundaries in living systems is of 
course difficult as information flow relies on the diffusion of mole-

2

cules  through  the cytoplasm.  This  entails  all  sorts  of  cross-
activities and complicates the design of functionally self-contained 
elements. Furthermore, many cellular elements have more than one 
function.  On  the  other  hand,  we  are  able  to  engineer  excellent 
specificities in small  molecule-protein, DNA-protein, and protein-
protein  interactions  that  help  to  functionally  separate  different 
elements. Furthermore, work on orthogonal (i.e. insulated) transla-
tional systems in general is only about to start, and first results are 
encouraging (Isaacs,  et  al.,  2004;  Rackham  and  Chin,  2005). Fi-
nally, there are strong ongoing efforts towards minimal (bacterial) 
systems and it can be expected that such systems – owing to their 
reduced  complexity –  have  a  much  smaller  number  of  cross-
reactions, so that implementation of novel elements stands a much 
better  chance  of  remaining  functionally  isolated.  In  summary,  we 
reason  that  even  though proper  system  boundaries  might  be  diffi-
cult to implement in current biological systems, there is good indi-
cation  that  these  systems  can  be  sufficiently  adapted  to  allow  this 
in the near future. 

[iii]  The  wide-spread  implementation  of  standards  in  biological 
design  has  never  been  a  serious  issue  in  biotechnology.  This  fact
resulted  in  a  large  diversity  in  bioengineering  tools  (strains,  plas-
mids, expression systems, etc) which hampers the wide distribution 
of  biological  parts  across  laboratories.  Current  attempts  to  imple-
ment  standards  (see  below)  have  the  potential  to  fundamentally 
change  this  and  have  already  helped  to  enable  the  operation  of 
large 
competition 
(http://parts.mit.edu),  where  more  than  30  projects  all  over  the 
world  rely  on  and  provide  parts  for  one  parts  warehouse  (see  be-
low).

[iv]  Finally,  the  biological  equivalent  to  fabrication  is  genomic 
scale de novo DNA synthesis, which - as we will discuss below - is 
increasingly possible already today.

We  have  to  point  out  that  there  is  a  fundamental  difference  be-
tween  engineering  biology  and  engineering  in  other  natural  sci-
ences  such  as  chemistry  or  physics:  biological  systems  have  the 
capacity to replicate and to evolve. This fundamental characteristic 
will  interfere  at  least  with  the  long-term  stability  of  a  number  of 
designed systems and will require constant monitoring of the integ-
rity (of crucial parts) of the systems. As the ultimate goal will be to 
build complex systems into specific hosts, it is likely that interfer-
ence  from  mutations  becomes  a  serious  issue.  However,  it  is  im-
portant to point out that the problem as such is not new to biotech-
nology  –  rather,  it  has  accompanied  every  major  strain  develop-
ment  effort  in  industrial  fermentation  and  has  contributed  to  the 
development  of  appropriate  selection  programs  for  sufficiently 
stable strains and suitable strain storage routines. 

In summary, we see synthetic biology as a novel, true engineer-
ing  approach  to  conducting  biotechnology. In  synthetic  biology,
we  would  include  endeavors  that  exploit  at  least  some  of  the  im-
portant elements of an engineering approach, as discussed, in their 
methodology.  For  example,  de  novo  DNA  synthesizing  an  entire 
pathway,  which  is  composed  of  genes  from  various  species  and
includes  optimized  codon usage,  adapted  secondary  mRNA  struc-
ture,  tailored  regulatory  elements,  and  a  restriction  site  strategy 
that allows the modular replacement of specific genes by improved 
versions,  can  be  considered  a  synthetic  biology  approach  to  a 
metabolic  engineering  problem.  Alternatively,

TOOLS AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES FOR 
SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY - FABRICATION

Synthetic biology aims to follow the standard engineering protocol 
of  design  and  fabrication.  We  will  discuss  first,  the  status  of  a 
number of items related to the issue of fabrication, including stan-
dardized cloning, de novo DNA synthesis and work on minimizing 
genomes.

3.1

Standardized cloning

Today,  traditional  cloning  represents  the  most  important  fabrica-
tion tool in synthetic biology. Using standard, typically PCR-based 
technologies,  an  existing  DNA  fragment  is  adapted  for  a  novel 
purpose and inserted into one of a myriad of different cloning vec-
tors according to the specifications of the multi-cloning site. Inser-
tion  of  alternative  elements  from  vectors  with  different  restriction 
site  structures  (for  example  from  different  laboratories),  introduc-
tion  of  point  mutations  for  novel  restriction  sites  or  adaptation  of 
codon  usage,  etc,  all  require  several  rounds  of  manipulations.  In 
other words, the current system fabrication process is laborious and 
inefficient. 

such 

as 

the 

An  important  initial  step  to  improve  the  situation  could  be  the 
introduction  of  a  standardized  vector  format  which  lends  itself 
easily  to  assembly  and  allows  interoperability  of  the  assembled 
sequences, 
“idempotent  vectors” 
(https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/21168/1/biobricks.pdf)  or 
the NOMAD technology (Rebatchouk, et al., 1996). Here, vectors 
are designed in such a way that insertion of a DNA fragment into a 
vector recreates exactly the same restriction site architecture. This 
way,  multiple  rounds  of  insertion  on  either  side  of  an  insert  are 
easily possible.

set  of 

Through  the  implementation  of  such  standards,  rapid exchange 
of  parts  is  made  possible  and  in  fact  realized  by  the  “Registry  of 
Standard Biological Parts” of the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology  working  group  on  synthetic  biology  (http://parts.mit.edu). 
The registry intends to serve as a source of well characterized parts 
that  have  been  formatted  according  to  specific  rules,  to  make  as-
sembly  easy.  Furthermore,  the  organization  of  the  registry  into 
basic DNA parts such as promoters, ribosome binding sites (RBS), 
and  coding  sequences  sparks  the  hope  that  it  will  become  much 
easier to obtain suitable genetic elements for a specific design pur-
pose,  so  that  ultimately  desired  experimental  outcomes  can  be 
achieved much faster.

Of course, the ideas for standardization need to remain open for 
optimization  and  will  hopefully  include  in  the  future  standardiza-
tion of strains  as  well  as  vectors  and  directions on  which  suitable 
cellular  parameters  should  be  quantified  by  which  standardized 
protocol.  Here,  it  should  be  pointed  out,  that  in  many  cases  the 
means  to  rapidly  quantify  the  important  connections  and  interac-
tions  between  parts  hardly  exist,  not  even  for  such  a  simple  con-
cept  as  promoter  strength. In  other  words,  to  be  successful  as  an 
engineering  discipline, synthetic  biology  will  need  to  repeat  the 
corresponding  developments  of  its  sister  engineering  disciplines 
that  have  lead  to  highly  organized  fields such  as  mechanical  and 
electrical engineering.

3.2

De novo DNA synthesis

Synthetic biology – putting engineering into biology

Even  after  the  potential  improvements  in  standardization  and  or-
ganization discussed  above,  parts  and  especially  system  assembly 
will  remain  a  major  issue  in  any  synthetic  biology  project. The 
question of how to produce physical instances of systems requiring 
tens  (existing  gene  networks)  or  even  hundreds  (genome  re-
programming)  of  kilobases  of  novel  DNA  sequence  is  basically,
still,  unsolved.  It  will  be  imperative  to  provide  access  to  de  novo
synthesized DNA sequences. This technology will allow assembly 
of  all  the  desired  changes  from  promoter  strength  to  codon usage 
directly into a novel sequence. This sequence should then be avail-
able within weeks or even days after its design. 

DNA  de  novo  synthesis  is  currently  performed  by  assembling 
overlapping  short  (25  to  70  bp  long)  and chemically  synthesized 
oligonucleotides  into  longer  DNA  fragments  in  a  PCR-based  as-
sembly  process  (Stemmer,  et  al.,  1995).  This  technology  has  al-
ready  led  to  the  complete  reconstruction  of  some  smaller  phage 
genomes  such  as  the  polio  virus (Cello,  et  al.,  2002).  However,  it 
suffers  from  two  major  cost  entries:  the  costs  of  synthesizing  the 
DNA  oligonucleotides  by  standard  phosphoamidite  chemistry  and 
the  limitations  in  the  accuracy  of  the  chemical  synthesis  (Young 
and  Dong,  2004).  For  example,  the  de  novo  reconstruction  of  the 
phage  (cid:1)(cid:2)174  genome  relied  on  a  two-fold  selection  process:  [i] 
oligonucleotides were first gel-purified to ensure the correct length 
of the set and [ii] correctly reassembled DNA was recovered from 
plaques after transformation, effectively providing a positive selec-
tion strategy for biological function (Smith, et al., 2003). Cost and 
accuracy  associated  with  the current  method  will  have  to  be  ad-
dressed  before  de  novo  DNA  synthesis  can  become  the  routine 
technology  that  will  be  required  to  fabricate  more  complex  bio-
logical systems.

Research to optimize the  current procedure follows three paths: 
[i]  miniaturizing  oligonucleotide  production;  [ii]  optimizing  se-
quence verification costs; and [iii] eliminating “false” oligonucleo-
tides by enzymatic and/or hybridization methods. 

[i] Regarding miniaturization, a promising, though not yet  fully 
developed,  option  is  the  utilization  of  microfluidics-based  arrays 
for synthesis. Exploiting the small scale should lead not only to a 
reduction  in  the  materials  costs  but  also  allow  optimized  reaction 
conditions  and  thus  reduce  error  frequencies  (Zhou,  et  al.,  2004). 
Alternatively,  oligonucleotide  synthesis  has  been  miniaturized  on 
photo-programmable chips (Tian, et al., 2004).

[ii]  Due  to  the  inherently  error-prone  chemical  DNA  synthesis 
process,  sequence  verification  of the  novel  fragment  is  important. 
As  the  error-frequency  is  increasing  with  oligonucleotide  length 
but oligo-assembly is simpler  with longer molecules, there should 
be an optimal oligonucleotide length from which to start assembly. 
This length is estimated to be 40 bp. From there, intermediary 500 
bp  “synthons”  are  assembled,  which  in  turn  are  assembled  into  5 
kb fragments (Kodumal, et al., 2004). 

[ii]  Finally,  different  techniques  can  be  used  to  remove  the  re-
maining errors: for example, it is highly unlikely that two synthe-
sized  complementary  oligonucleotides  will  have  mutations  in 
complementary  positions,  so  there  will  be  mismatches.  These  can 
serve  as  entry  points  for  digestion  of  different  enzyme  systems
(Greger and Kemper, 1998; Smith and Modrich, 1997; Young and 
Dong,  2004).  Alternatively,  such  erroneous  oligonucleotides  can 
be sorted out by having all the oligonucleotides designed to hybrid-
ize at one specific temperature and then very carefully control this 
temperature  during  hybridization.  Oligonucleotides  with  mis-

matches  can  then  be  washed  away (Tian,  et  al.,  2004).  Combina-
tions of these approaches put the current accuracy at error rates of 
only 1 in 1400 bp (Tian, et al., 2004). 

In  summary,  if  synthesis  costs  can  be  reduced  by  a  factor  ten 
from  the  current  prices  in  the  order  of  1 US$/bp, it  is  clear  that 
DNA  de  novo  synthesis  will  become  an  overwhelming  force  in 
systems fabrication. Coupled to community-wide standards on the 
availability,  documentation,  characterization,  and  standardization
of parts, there is reasonable perspective to eliminate system  fabri-
cation as a prohibitive part in future synthetic biology endeavors.

3.3

Providing engineering chassis

Designed and synthesized DNA segments that encode novel func-
tions need to be implemented into a suitable organism, for the time 
being,  by  one  of  the  many  available  genome  engineering  tech-
niques  (see,  for  example,  (Kolisnychenko,  et  al.,  2002)), or  in  the 
future  by  novel  mega-size  cloning  strategies  (Itaya,  et  al.,  2005). 
As the complexity of existing biological systems is the major prob-
lem  in  implementing  synthetic  biology’s  engineering  vision,  it  is 
desirable  to  reduce  this  complexity.  One  option  is  to  reduce  the 
genome of the host - the chassis - into which the new sequence is 
implemented,  which  would  eliminate  many  possibilities  for  inter-
ference.  For  an  intended  chemical  production  with  the  designed 
system, this genome reduction will probably be limited to reducing 
the  metabolic  capabilities of  a  strain.  A  true  “minimal  genome”  -
the minimum set of genes that is necessary for a cell to propagate 
under specific environmental conditions – would be a useful point 
to  start  when  trying  to  engage  in  re-building  more  complex  sys-
tems (Forster and Church, 2006). 

According  to  theoretical  considerations,  growth  in  the  presence 
of a rich but synthetic and defined medium requires as few as 206 
genes,  basically  comprising  the  DNA  replication,  transcriptional, 
and  translational  machinery,  rudimentary  DNA  repair  functions, 
protein processing and degradation, cell division, and rudimentary 
metabolic  and  energy  functions  (Gil,  et  al.,  2004).  Towards  this 
goal,  one  can  either  substantially  reduce  the  relatively  large  ge-
nomes of established model systems and exploit the abundance of 
molecular biology tools for these model organisms, or work on the 
already very small genome of other organisms in exchange for the 
requirement to develop novel molecular biology tools. 

Regarding  the  latter,  non-pathogenic Mesoplasma  florum with 
very attractive cultivation properties and a genome size of 793 kb, 
is  currently  being  established  as  such  a  chassis.  Its  genomic  se-
quence  has  recently  become  available and  molecular  biology 
methods  are  developed. A  similar  approach  is  followed  with  My-
coplasma genitalium,  for  which  extensive  data  on  non-essential 
genes is available (Glass, et al., 2006).

Regarding the former, a prominent example is E. coli whose ge-
nome  has  been  reduced  in  various  projects  by  6% (Yu,  et  al., 
2002),  8% (Kolisnychenko,  et  al.,  2002),  or  15%  (Posfai,  et  al, 
2006),  without  any  noticeable  effect  on  the  investigated  physio-
logical  properties  and  by  30%  resulting  in  defects  in  cell  replica-
tion  (Hashimoto,  et  al., 2005).  Bacillus  subtilis’  genome  has  been 
reduced  by  8%,  again  with  only  minor  effects  on  physiology 
(Westers,  et  al.,  2003),  confirming  the  hypothesis that  under  con-
trolled  laboratory  conditions  a  substantial  part  of  a  bacterium’s 
genome is indeed dispensable.

4 EXAMPLES FOR SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY 

ENDEAVORS

The  ultimate  goal  of  synthetic  biology  is  the  efficient  design  of 
biological systems. In a few areas, this has already advanced quite 
substantially. Here, we will outline examples - at various levels of 
complexity - of protein, circuit, and system engineering.

4.1

Engineering of proteins

To  facilitate  the  design  process,  it  would  be  highly  desirable  to 
have  protein  modules  that  are  functionally  self-contained  and  can 
be freely combined to new functionalities. The domain architecture 
of  many regulatory proteins plays very  much in favor of such ap-
proaches.

One  specific  example  how  novel  functionality  can  be  obtained 
from recombining protein modules is the design of polydactyl zinc 
finger DNA-binding proteins (Blancafort, et al., 2004). Here, com-
binations  of  zinc  finger  domains  provide  the  sequence  specificity 
of  the  DNA-binding  domain  (DBD)  by  essentially  recognizing  a 
subset  of  three  or  four  nucleotides  per  zinc  finger  domain.  Such 
proteins  display  modularity  in  two  ways:  typically,  the  DBD  is 
functionally independent from the effector domain and zinc finger 
domains  are  functionally,  relatively  independent  from  each  other. 
Therefore by  selecting  a  set  of  specific  zinc  fingers  in  silico  one 
can specify arbitrary sequence specificity for a novel DBD, which 
can then be coupled to a novel effector domain. 

The  success  rates  in  this  process  can  be  quite  attractive.  The 
zinc-finger  design  can  for  example  be  based  on  a  comprehensive 
table of zinc fingers covering all possible binding DNA-sequences 
for a single zinc-finger. This table has been compiled by extrapola-
tions from X-ray structures and 5 out of 10 combinations of three 
zinc-fingers  selected  from  this  table  showed  indeed  excellent 
DNA-binding  properties  for  decamer  DNA-sequences (Sera  and 
Uranga,  2002). Even  better  rates  can  be  achieved  when  the  func-
tional  modularity  between  adjacent  zinc-fingers  is  improved  by 
combinatorial  and  rational  approaches.  Currently,  the  correspond-
ing  designs  are  available  for  all  possible  5’-GNN  (Segal,  et  al., 
1999)  and  5’-ANN  (Dreier,  et  al.,  2001) DNA-target  sequences 
and have been successfully exploited for specific binding of up to 
octadecamer DNA sequences (Dreier, et al., 2001). 

Similar functional reprogramming could also be achieved on the 
level  of  protein-protein  interactions  with  signaling  proteins.  For 
example, the eukaryotic neuronal N-WASP protein accommodates 
the substitution of its receiving domains or changes in their affini-
ties,  insertion  of  alternative  linker  structures  between  domains, 
different  N-WASP  output  domains,  and  even  different  domain 
architectures.  These  changes  produced  proteins  with  completely 
new logical behavior (Dueber, et al., 2003). 

Other  exploitations  of  functional  modularity  in  signaling  path-
ways  stem  from  scaffold  proteins  that  recruit  a  kinase  and  the 
kinase’s  substrate,  assemble  them  in  close  proximity  for  phos-
phorylation,  and  thus  provide  specificity (Park,  et  al.,  2003).  The 
domain structure of theses scaffolds allows to recombine scaffolds 
that  share  the  same  “nodes”  (a  common  kinase  that  interacts  with 
both  scaffolds)  and  thus  to  redirect  signals  to  novel  outputs,  such 
as making osmotolerance a function of the induction of the mating 
signaling  pathway  (Park,  et  al.,  2003).  In  human  cell  lines,  mito-
genic  signals  can  be  rewired  to  apoptotic  behavior by  the  same 
strategy (Howard, et al., 2003).

The  above  results  have  to  be  seen  in  the  light  of  recent  im-
provements in the algorithms for computational design of proteins
that  allow  for  example  the  rational  engineering  of  novel substrate 
binding  specificities  (Looger,  et  al.,  2003) or  even  the  conversion 
of binding proteins into functional enzymes (Dwyer, et al., 2004). 
The  novel  enzyme  possessed a  catalytic  constant  in  the  order  of 
0.1 s-1,  which  is  at  least  one  to  two  orders  of  magnitudes  higher 
than  previous  comparable  efforts (Bolon,  et  al.,  2002).  Taken  to-
gether,  the  recent  successes  in  modular  protein  engineering  and 
computational design suggest that rational protein design for many 
applications will be feasible in the near future. 

4.2

Engineering of artificial gene networks

Significant efforts were recently undertaken in the design of artifi-
cial genetic networks in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Here, 

different  genetic  elements  or  “parts”  are  (ultimately)  rationally 
combined  to  “devices”  to  realize  specific  cellular  behaviors  that 
have frequently analogies to elements from electric circuits such as 
switches  and  oscillators.  We  will  outline  recent  efforts  in  the  de-
velopment  of  networks  with  complex  behaviors and  for  cell-cell-
communication.
4.2.1  Switches. A  switch  lets  the  cell  adopt  one  of  two  possible 
states,  depending  either  on  the presence  or  absence  of  a  chemical 
inducer,  or  on  two  separate  external  stimuli  (toggle  switch) 
(Becskei, et al., 2001).

The  latter  behavior  can  be  easily  designed  from  any  two  rep-
ressors  that  reciprocally  inhibit  the  transcription  of  their  genes 
(Fig.  2A) (Gardner,  et  al.,  2000;  Kramer,  et  al.,  2004).  Switching
between  states  can  be  achieved  by  intermittently  inactivating  the 
repressor that maintains the current state (such as adding a chemi-

cal  inducer  or  increasing  the  temperature).  Essentially,  this  prop-
erty  conveys  a  cell  with  a  memory  of  its  previous  cultivation his-
tory and thus represents an epigenetic toggle switch. 
    The former behavior requires positive feedback in the regulatory 
processes, such as [i] the positive autoregulation of a positive regu-
lator’s gene transcription or [ii] the concomitant upregulation of an 
operon by external inducer and of the gene that encodes the trans-
porter  protein  for  entrance  of  the  inducer.  Besides  the  artificial 
design of such systems, this behavior is rather common in a num-
ber  of  well-characterized  bacterial  expression  systems  such  as  the 
bacterial  lactose  and  arabinose  systems,  (Atkinson,  et  al.,  2003; 
Khlebnikov, et al., 2001; Ozbudak, et al., 2004; Vilar, et al., 2003). 
In addition, the artificial gene networks can be engineered with a 
hysteretic  character,  so  that  the  system  switches  into  the  “ON” 
state at a higher concentration of external signal than is required to 
switch back to the “OFF” state. This requires that the concentration 
of activator or active repressor can be made a  function of the his-
tory of the cell, e. g. by adding another regulatory layer on top of 
the  positive  feedback  element.  This  can  be  a  concentration-
dependent inactivation of a repressor that competes with an activa-
tor (Fig. 2B). Depending on the previous state of the cell, a given 
concentration  of  active  repressor  interacts  with  either  high  or  low 
concentrations of activators, leading to a differentiation in response 
depending  on  the  history (Atkinson,  et  al.,  2003;  Kramer  and 
Fussenegger, 2005).

4.2.2  Complex  networks. In  an  oscillator,  an  artificial  network  is
used  to  produce  regular  fluctuations  in  network  elements such  as
reporter  proteins.  Oscillators  have  been  realized  in  two  ways:  as 
ring-oscillators (“repressilators” (Fig. 2C)) or as a combination of 
activation  and  repression  elements.  The  ring  oscillator  consists  of 
three repressor genes that are coupled to three corresponding pro-
moters  in  such  a  way,  that  each  repressor  protein  can  turn  off  the 
synthesis  of  one  other  repressor  protein.  This  design  worked  on 
single cell level, but not on culture-level, which probably has to do 
with  the  noise involved  on  gene  expression  level  (see  below)
(Elowitz and Leibler, 2000). However, by combining positive and 
negative  regulation,  it  is  possible  to  reduce  the  noise  to  such  a 
degree  that  population-synchronized  oscillation  behavior  over 
three  periods  can  be  observed  in  a  turbidostat  (Atkinson,  et  al., 
2003).  Interestingly,  such  oscillating  systems  can  be  extended  to 
include metabolite concentrations (Fung, et al., 2005).

In  order  to  execute  ever  more  complex  logical  behavior,  it  will 
be  important to  be  able  to  “integrate”  more  and  more  signals  into 
determining  one  or  more  cellular  functions.  This  is  facilitated  by 
the  high  level  of  modularity  in  the  regulatory  elements of  eu-
karyotic systems. This modularity makes them particularly amena-
ble to design and can be used to implement a wide variety of logi-
cal behaviors for two and three signal inputs while exploiting only 
a limited number of genetic elements (Kramer, et al., 2004). 

4.2.3 Networks for intercellular communications. Creating macro-
scopically observable artificial  functional behavior in a cell popu-
lation requires some kind of synchronization. Such synchronization 
can be enforced by adding chemical inducers or by letting the cells 
themselves  produce  a  signal  in  response  to  a  change  in  a  culture 
property.  One  example  for  such  a  property  is  cell  density  which 
can  be  communicated  by  quorum  sensing,  for  example  via  the 
luxR/luxI  system  of  Vibrio  fischeri  or  via  artificially  engineered 

6

systems such as acetate accumulation in E. coli cultures (Bulter, et 
al., 2004).

The luxR/luxI system has been used to trigger a variety of popu-
lation-density  dependent  responses,  such  as  flipping  of  a  toggle 
switch (Kobayashi, et al., 2004) or programmed population control 
(You,  et  al.,  2004).  The  system has  also  been  exploited  to  design
spatial  patterns  of  behavior  that re-build  aspects  of  multicellular 
systems (Fig. 2D):  When producer cells send the autoinducer sig-
nal of the lux system via diffusion through a plate, cells at different 
distances  from  the  senders  experience  differently  steep  gradients 
once the autoinducer reaches them. Alternatively, cells can be used 
to  detect  the  differences  in  inducer  concentration  in  resulting 
(quasi-)steady  state.  Networks  can  be  designed  which  are  able  to 
detect  these  rather  subtle  differences  in  environmental  conditions 
and  which  translate  them  into adequate  cellular  responses  such  as 
different pulses of reporter proteins or stable colorimetric patterns
(Basu,  et  al.,  2005;  Basu,  et  al.,  2004),  introducing  space  as  an 
additional design-parameter into the synthetic biology realm.  

4.2.4 Issues related to the design of genetic circuits. For the design 
of  genetic  networks,  the  availability  of  functional  elements  with
specific  properties  (such  as  binding  constants  and degradation 
rates)  that  fit  the  design  purpose  is  crucial.  So  far,  we  are  only  at 
the  beginning  of  being  able  to  easily  measure,  let  alone  program 
kinetic  parameters,  cooperativities, or  binding  constants  (see 
above).  Consequently,  the  design  process  remains  - for  the  time 
being - an iterative process that still contains considerable elements 
of  trial  and  error. Nevertheless,  some  workaround  tools  are  avail-
able today in order to – at least crudely – shift certain characteris-
tics  from  wild-type  values  to  values  that  allow  a  desired behavior
to  be  implemented.  These  include  variations  in  gene  dosage  via 
changes  in  plasmid  replicon  (e. g.  (Atkinson,  et  al.,  2003)),  the 
increase of protein degradation rates by fusion to suitable protease 
sensitive  tag-sequences  (Elowitz  and  Leibler,  2000),  variations  in 
the strength of RBSs (e. g. (Yokobayashi, et al., 2002)), or drawing 
on the large number of mutants that are available for a number of
model systems (such as phage (cid:1), the lac system, or the tet system).
Alternatively, parameters can be adapted to the desired behavior by 
directed evolution, if a suitable assay is available (Yokobayashi, et 
al., 2002). However, it is not really clear how such directed evolu-
tion  assays  can be  easily  tailored  to  screen  for  relatively  subtle 
differences in properties important for optimizing design. In sum-
mary, a primary task  for the immediate future is to gain access to 
complete system parameter sets, which can then serve as the start-
ing point to produce parts with parameter values that span suitable 
ranges. 

4.3

Engineering of systems

Synthetic biology is a very young discipline that follows a power-
ful technological vision. However, there are no examples available 
where  the  whole  approach  (as  sketched  above)  has  been  imple-
mented.  Still,  in  some  cases  specific  aspects  of  synthetic  biology 
have  been  of  critical  importance.  We  will  discuss  the  following 
examples:  the  design  of  an  E.  coli  capable  of  image  processing, 
refactoring of the phage T7, the design of novel polyketide antibi-
otics, and the manufacturing of precursors for the anti-malaria drug 
artemisinin. 

An  original  example  for  new  applications that  derives  from  the 
interface  of  engineering  and  life  sciences,  which  came  out  of  the

iGEM  student  competition,  is  the  image-processing  E. coli.  By 
designing  proteins  that  couple  light-detection  to  well-known 
E. coli  regulatory  circuits,  first  steps  towards light-detecting  pixel 
sizes  of  micrometer  dimensions  are  possible (Levskaya,  et  al., 
2005).

A more fundamental aspect is covered by the work on the phage 
T7, which tries to help to answer the question whether it is indeed 
possible to refactor significant portions of small genomes. In other 
words,  can  we  indeed  modify  those  genomes  according  to  the  re-
quirements  of  “engineerability”  such  as  monofunctionality  of  a 
part  of  the  sequence  and  organization  of  the  DNA  into  functional 
segments. Refactoring 10 kb of the T7 genome, representing about 
a  quarter  of  the  total  genome,  still  produces functional  phages, 
though  their  efficiency  in  propagation  is  reduced (Chan,  et  al., 
2005).  This  is  an  important  validation  of  the  synthetic  biology
approach,  even  though  on  a  small  scale.  It  remains  to  be  seen 
whether  the  same  concepts  can  be  applied  to  more  complex  sys-
tems such as microbes.

Two  examples  for  application  of  synthetic  biology  concepts 
come from the area of pharmaceutical production and involve pri-
marily  the  opportunities  offered  by  de  novo  DNA  synthesis,  such 
as the direct adaptation of codon usage, implementation of suitable 
regulatory  circuitry,  and  the  possibility  to  modularize  the  DNA 
sequences  by  restriction  sites  to  facilitate  iterative  optimizations. 
The  first  example  involves  the  adaptation  of  polyketide  synthesis 
to  well  studied  E.  coli  production  strains  (Kodumal,  et  al.,  2004)
and  the  subsequent  design  of  novel  polyketides  by  semi-
randomized  recombination  of  polyketide  synthase  genes.  These 
recombinations  were  easily  enforced  along  the  interfaces  of  the 
different functional modules that make up a synthase and resulted 
in  a  rather  high  success  rate  of  detecting  novel  polyketides
(Menzella, et al., 2005).

Along  similar  lines,  another  project  that  very  much  catches  the 
spirit  of  synthetic  biology  is  the  construction,  from  scratch, of  a 
cheap terpenoid production pathway in E. coli leading to artemis-
inic  acid,  a  precursor  to  the  anti-malaria  drug  artemisinin.  This 
goal essentially requires the design of an entirely new pathway in a 
suitable  production  organism.  The  corresponding  pathway  ele-
ments can be recruited from bacteria (E. coli), yeast (Saccharomy-
ces  cerevisiae),  and  plant  (Artemisa  annua),  redesigned  and  func-
tionally expressed in bacteria or yeast, effectively paving the road 
to  a  low-cost  production  route  to  effective  malaria  treatment
(Martin, et al., 2003; Ro, et al., 2006).

Although  the  design  of  novel  biological  systems  is  only  begin-
ning,  all  ingredients  of  the  engineering  approach  are  visible:  the 
role  of  de  novo  DNA  synthesis/fabrication,  the  design  of  well-
behaved  parts  on  the  DNA  and  protein  level,  the  organization  of 
parts into the next functional level of devices and the correspond-
ing abstractions, and the attempt to introduce standardization, even 
though for the time being only on a parts level. With the design of 
ever more complex systems, the need to emphasize these elements 
will undoubtedly increase.

5 REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPUTATIONAL AND 

INFORMATIC EXPERTISE

Synthetic  biology  encompasses  the  building  of  novel  biological 
entities  for  useful  purposes  and  the  corresponding  endeavors  can 
be subdivided into two distinct types of tasks: systems design and 

Synthetic biology – putting engineering into biology

systems fabrication. Here, we will discuss the essential elements of 
these  two  tasks  with  a  special  focus  on  the  computational  and in-
formatics requirements.

Fabrication  deals  with  the  transformation  of  design  plans  into 
actual  physical  instances.  Today,  this  still  involves  a  significant 
amount  of  cloning  work,  which  should  decrease  in  the  future  due 
to de novo DNA synthesis (see above). The fabrication as such, is 
not expected to create a great demand for novel informatics tools. 

In contrast, systems design consisting of forward-engineering of 
biological  parts,  devices  or  systems  strongly  relies  on  computing 
and  informatics  tools  that  assist  the  design  process.  Ultimately,  it 
would  be  desirable  to  have  computer  aided  design  tools  –  CAD 
tools for biological engineering - in analogy to the respective soft-
ware  tools  in  the  areas  of  mechanical  or  civil  engineering.  Using 
such  software,  the  synthetic  biology  design  engineer  would  try  to 
improve the behavior of a biological system in silico by optimizing 
design  parameters  targeting  a  selected  objective  function.  Design 
variants would be tested computationally by means of simulations.

Such  design  tools  will  be  based  on  quantitative  mechanistic 
models  that  reproduce  biological behavior,  and  -  in  order  to  be 
useful for forward-engineering design - would also have predictive 
power. In biology, we have not yet reached a level of understand-
ing  where  such  models  can  be  developed  on  a  large  scale,  and 
consequently,  true  biological  engineering  is  hardly  possible  until 
now  (Endy  and  Brent,  2001).  In fact, in  most cases today,  we  are 
faced  with  highly  uncertain  or  even  unknown  model  topologies, 
mechanisms  and  parameters.  The  recent  advances  in  the  post-
genomic  research  and  especially  in  systems  biology,  however, 
provide hope that sooner or later we will be able to draw on a body 
of  knowledge  that  allows  for  the  envisioned  directed  engineering 
of biology (Endy and Brent, 2001). Ultimately, mathematical mod-
els  developed  for  research  purposes  (e.g.  in  systems  biology)  will 
be employed as design  models in synthetic biology. In contrast to 
the  current  lack of  predictive  models,  tools  for  modelling  and 
simulation exist in large numbers (cf. (Lemerle, et al., 2005)).

We envision that in the long run we will require models and de-
sign software for the following tasks: [i] sequence-based (ab initio) 
prediction  of  structure,  function  and  interactions  of  macromole-
cules,  in  particular  proteins  and  mRNA,  [ii]  prediction  of  the  dy-
namics of signaling and regulatory networks; and [iii] prediction of 
the  dynamics  of  metabolic  networks.  For  each  of  these  areas,  we 
will  shortly  sketch  the  current  status  of  development  and  also 
elaborate on future tasks.

5.1

Design of functions and interactions of macro-
molecules

We  would  like  to  predict  -  starting  from  a  linear  sequence  of  nu-
cleotides  or  amino  acids  – 2D  (mRNA)  and  3D  structures  of  the 
respective macromolecules (RNA, proteins), as well as their func-
tion  and  their  interaction  parameters  with  other  cellular  compo-
nents  (DNA,  metabolites,  etc.).  In  other  words,  as  outlined  above 
we  would  like  to  have  the  possibility  to  modify  sequences  in  a 
targeted manner to obtain, for example, novel transcription factors 
(i.e.  with  altered  binding  constants  or  kinetics)  or  proteins  with 
novel functions introduced.

However today, as an example, de novo protein structure predic-
tion  from  a  linear  amino  acids  sequence  can only  be  achieved  for 
small protein domains at significant computational costs (Bradley, 
et  al.,  2005;  Misura,  et  al.,  2006).  Nevertheless,  starting  from

known structures of ‘scaffold’ proteins, design methods are  avail-
able, which can be used to rationally modify the proteins’ structure 
and function, i.e. to build completely new active sites into proteins 
(Dwyer, et al., 2004) or to redesign binding specificities of proteins 
(Looger,  et  al.,  2003).  However,  such  design  processes  still  go 
through  several  cycles  of  iterative  improvement  involving  design, 
analysis,  redesign,  etc.,  where  computational  tools  such  as  FoldX 
(Schymkowitz,  et  al.,  2005)  are  typically  employed.  In  other 
words,  the  design  of  tailored  catalytic  activities  on  artificial  pro-
teins  seems  to  be  within  reach,  while  quantitative  prediction  of 
enzymatic  activity  and  selectivity  from  3D  protein  structures  in 
general  is  not  yet  feasible.  For  further  information  on  the  current 
status in modeling of protein structures and interactions, the reader 
is referred to a recent review (Schueler-Furman, et al., 2005).

Based on structure models, molecular dynamics simulation have 
shown to be a versatile tool to investigate the dynamic behavior of 
complexes between DNA binding sites and respective DNA target 
sites (Marco, et al., 2003; Obika, et al., 2003). These tools can also 
be employed to predict the effect of structural modulations on pro-
tein-ligand  interactions  in  a  way  that  would  allow  forward-
engineering  design  of,  for  example,  DNA-binding  specificity  of 
transcription factors.

5.2

Design of signaling and regulatory networks

Artificial  signaling  and  regulatory  gene  networks  will  need  to  be 
assembled  for synthetic biology.  Today, such circuits are still  fre-
quently  assembled  by  intuition  and  optimized  through  several 
rounds of trial-and-error (Kærn, et al., 2003) and the mathematical 
models  are  only  developed  once  proper  in  vivo  function  has  been 
demonstrated.  Deterministic  or  stochastic  models  (or  a  combina-
tion  of  both)  are  then  used  to  describe  the  observed  dynamic  be-
havior of the circuit (Fung, et al., 2005; Gardner, et al., 2000; Ko-
bayashi, et al., 2004; You, et al., 2004). 

Ideal,  however,  would  be  models  that  allow deriving  in  silico 
suggestions  for  optimal  design  strategies  or  debugging,  prior  to 
implementation of the circuit in vivo (Gardner, et al., 2000; Sprin-
zak and Elowitz, 2005). Such models should be able to capture the 
dynamic behavior of the gene networks. In cases where only small 
molecule numbers are involved (as in gene transcription or transla-
tion, where transcription factors and mRNA molecules only occur 
in  low  copy  numbers),  the  models  would  also  need  to  be  able  to 
reproduce the inherent stochasticity of such processes. This is im-
perative  as  it  was  shown  that  stochasticity  in  combination  with 
certain  system  architectures  can  result  in  different  system  states 
(Kærn, et al., 2005; Pedraza and van Oudenaarden, 2005). A robust 
design  of  new  devices  and  systems  must  exclude  such  eventuali-
ties. 

In  summary,  to  enable  the  envisioned  forward-engineering 
(model-based)  design  of  signaling  and  regulatory  circuits,  im-
provements  are  required  in  the  following  areas:  It  is  necessary  [i] 
to obtain an improved quantitative understanding of regulatory and 
signaling  processes  (Sprinzak  and  Elowitz,  2005);  [ii]  to  develop 
effective rules (cf. (Wall, et al., 2003; Wall, et al., 2004)) and stan-
dards for characterizing modules (Kærn, et al., 2003; Sprinzak and 
Elowitz,  2005),  and  [iii]  to  improve  multiscale  simulation  algo-
rithms as the existing ones are limited in a way that the participat-
ing  reactions  have  to  occur  on  a  comparative  time  scale  and  the 
participating reaction species have to fulfill certain population size 
requirements.

5.3

Design of metabolic networks

Besides  the  design  and  construction  of  signaling  and  regulatory 
networks,  we  would  also  like  to  engineer  metabolic  networks. 
Models currently available in this area are [i] stoichiometric mod-
els  which  display  –  in  most  cases  on  a  genome-wide  level  –  an 
organism’s  metabolic  (stoichiometric)  capabilities and  [ii]  enzy-
matic  reaction  network  models,  which  describe  the  kinetics  of  a 
network  but  mostly  cover  only  small  and  well  studied  areas  of 
metabolism. 

For design of metabolic networks based on stoichiometric mod-
els,  the  most  prominent  tools  to  analyze  these  networks  are  flux 
balance analysis (FBA) (Edwards, et al., 1999; Varma and Palsson, 
1994) and elementary flux mode (Schuster, et al., 1999) or extreme 
pathways  analysis  (Schilling,  et  al.,  2000).  Extended  tools  -  con-
ceptually based on FBA -  were  developed that allow assisting the 
targeted  modification  of  existing  or  the  design  of  new,  metabolic 
networks (Patil, et al., 2005; Pharkya, et al., 2004).

On the side of the kinetic models (consisting of ordinary differ-
ential  equations),  a  large  set  of  models  is  available  from  model 
repositories  (cf.  www.siliconcell.net).  However,  due  to  largely 
unknown  reaction  mechanisms  and  parameters,  these  models  in 
most cases only cover small parts of metabolism. Tools for model-
ing and simulation are widely available ranging from general simu-
lation  platforms,  such  as  SmartCell  (http://smartcell.embl.de/, 
(Ander, et al., 2004)), via object-oriented software suites (www.e-
cell.org) to web-based suites  for  modeling, simulation, and analy-
sis of biological cells (http://www.webcell.org/) (Lee, et al., 2006). 
An  overview  about  available 
tools  can  be  obtained  from 
http://sbml.org.

6 CONCLUSION

The move from describing biology to exploiting it for our require-
ments has always been a part of the biological enterprise – and thus 
always  reflected  the  current  main  lines  of  biological  research.  So,
as  molecular biology has  for a long time attempted to unravel the 
molecular mechanisms that are important in cellular function, bio-
technology  has  exploited  this  knowledge  and  adopted  some  of 
these mechanisms to produce chemicals, enzymes, and biopharma-
ceuticals.  Now,  synthetic  biology is  adopting  a  very  ambitious 
agenda in building novel biological entities on an ever more com-
plex level for novel applications.

Currently, biology is characterized by the shift from the study of 
single  aspects  of  systems  to  the  appreciation  of  the  system  as  a 
whole. With this goes the expectation that many of the failures that 
biotechnology  suffered  can  be understood  from  this  new  perspec-
tive.  At  the  same  time,  to  advance  exploitation  of  biological  sys-
tems (instead of single aspects), we adopt an approach that is suffi-
ciently organized and robust. We adapt our technologies – for ex-
ample in fabrication – and in methodologies – such as design – to 
the new system-scale of the task through adopting the crucial ele-
ments of classical, non-life science related engineering disciplines. 
The  aspects that  have  been  discussed  here,  from  de  novo  DNA 
synthesis  via  modular  protein  design,  the  design  of  novel  gene 
networks, to the reconstruction of artificial pathways, address - in 
our view - this transition in an exemplary way.
