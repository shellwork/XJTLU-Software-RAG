It has been proposed1 that gene-regulatory circuits with virtually
any desired property can be constructed from networks of simple
regulatory elements. These properties, which include multistabil-
ity and oscillations, have been found in specialized gene circuits
such as the bacteriophage l switch2 and the Cyanobacteria
circadian oscillator3. However, these behaviours have not been
demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory compo-
nents. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle
switch—a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network—in
Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the
conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed
from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually
inhibitory network. It is ﬂipped between stable states using
transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly
ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch
forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has
implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.
The design and construction of synthetic gene-regulatory net-
works would be greatly facilitated by a theory with predictive
capability. Previous work using a reconstituted enzyme system4
showed that nonlinear mathematics can predict qualitative beha-
viours of biochemical reaction networks, including multistability
and hysteresis. However, a practical theory of gene-regulatory
networks has lagged behind that of enzyme regulatory networks.
A variety of physical and mathematical approaches,
including
logical (discrete)5–10, piecewise linear11, nonlinear12–14, statistical–
mechanical15,16 and stochastic17–19 formulations of the underlying
biochemical dynamics, have been used in the past. Owing to the
difﬁculty of testing their predictions, these theories have not, in
general, been veriﬁed experimentally. Here we have integrated
theory and experiment by constructing and testing a synthetic,
bistable gene circuit based on the predictions of a simple mathe-
matical model.

The toggle switch is composed of two repressors and two
constitutive promoters (Fig. 1). Each promoter is inhibited by the
repressor that is transcribed by the opposing promoter. We selected
this design for the toggle switch because it requires the fewest genes
and cis-regulatory elements to achieve robust bistable behaviour. By
robust, we mean that the toggle exhibits bistability over a wide range
of parameter values and that the two states are tolerant of the
ﬂuctuations inherent in gene expression (the toggle switch will not
ﬂip randomly between states). Although bistability is theoretically
possible with a single, autocatalytic promoter, it would be less

robust and more difﬁcult to tune experimentally. In addition, the
chosen toggle design does not require any specialized promoters,
such as the PR/PRM promoter of bacteriophage l. Bistability is
possible with any set of promoters and repressors as long as they
fulﬁl the minimum set of conditions described in Box 1 and Fig. 2.
The bistability of the toggle arises from the mutually inhibitory
arrangement of the repressor genes. In the absence of inducers, two
stable states are possible: one in which promoter 1 transcribes
repressor 2, and one in which promoter 2 transcribes repressor 1.
Switching is accomplished by transiently introducing an inducer of
the currently active repressor. The inducer permits the opposing
repressor to be maximally transcribed until it stably represses the
originally active promoter.

All toggle switches are implemented on E. coli plasmids confer-
ring ampicillin resistance and containing the pBR322 ColE1 repli-
cation origin. The toggle switch genes are arranged as a type IV
plasmid, as shown in Fig. 3. Although all genes and promoters are

Box 1
The toggle model

The behaviour of the toggle switch and the conditions for bistability can
be understood using the following dimensionless model for the network:

2 u

a2

1 (cid:135) ug

2 v

(cid:133)1a(cid:134)

(cid:133)1b(cid:134)

where u is the concentration of repressor 1, v is the concentration of
repressor 2, a1 is the effective rate of synthesis of repressor 1, a2 is the
effective rate of synthesis of repressor 2, b is the cooperativity of
repression of promoter 2 and g is the cooperativity of repression of
promoter 1. The above model is derived from a biochemical rate equation
formulation of gene expression24–27. The ﬁnal form of the toggle equations
preserves the two most fundamental aspects of the network: cooperative
repression of constitutively transcribed promoters (the ﬁrst term in each
equation), and degradation/dilution of the repressors (the second term in
each equation).

The parameters a1 and a2 are lumped parameters that describe the

net effect of RNA polymerase binding, open-complex formation,
transcript elongation, transcript termination, repressor binding, ribosome
binding and polypeptide elongation. The cooperativity described by b
and g can arise from the multimerization of the repressor proteins and the
cooperative binding of repressor multimers to multiple operator sites in
the promoter. An additional modiﬁcation to equation (1) is needed to
describe induction of the repressors (Fig. 5).

The geometric structure of equation (1), illustrated in Fig. 2a and b,

reveals the origin of the bistability: the nullclines (du=dt (cid:136) 0 and dv=dt (cid:136) 0
in Fig. 2) intersect at three points, producing one unstable and two stable
steady states. From Fig. 2a and b, three key features of the system
become apparent. First, the nullclines intersect three times because of
their sigmoidal shape, which arises for b, g . 1. Thus, the bistability of the
system depends on the cooperative repression of transcription. Second,
the rates of synthesis of the two repressors must be balanced. If the rates
are not balanced, the nullclines will intersect only once, producing a
single stable steady state. This situation arises in plasmid pIKE105. Third,
the structure of the toggle network creates two basins of attraction. Thus,
a toggle with an initial condition anywhere above the separatrix will
ultimately settle to state 1, whereas a toggle starting below the separatrix
will settle to state 2.

The conditions for a bistable toggle network are illustrated in Fig. 2c
and d. As the rates of repressor synthesis are increased, the size of the
bistable region increases. Furthermore, the slopes of the bifurcation lines,
for large a1 and a2, are determined by b and g. Thus, to obtain bistability,
at least one of the inhibitors must repress expression with cooperativity
greater than one. Moreover, higher order cooperativity will increase the
robustness of the system, allowing weaker promoters to achieve
bistability and producing a broader bistable region.

contained on a single plasmid, they could, in principle, be divided
into two separate plasmids without altering the functionality of the
toggle. Two classes of toggle switch plasmids were constructed—the
pTAK class and the pIKE class. Both classes use the Lac repressor
(lacI) in conjunction with the Ptrc-2 promoter for one promoter–
repressor pair. For the second promoter–repressor pair (P1, R1 in
Fig. 3), pTAK plasmids use the PLs1con promoter in conjunction
with a temperature-sensitive l repressor (cIts), whereas pIKE
plasmids use the PLtetO-1 promoter in conjunction with the Tet
repressor (tetR). pTAK plasmids are switched between states by a
pulse of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) or a thermal
pulse. pIKE plasmids are switched between states by a pulse of IPTG
or a pulse of anhydrotetracycline (aTc).

The promoters used in the toggle are PLtetO-1 (ref. 20) (TetR
repressed), Ptrc-2 (LacI repressed) and PLs1con (CI repressed). The
ranked order of the transcriptional efﬁciencies of the promoters is
PLs1con . Ptrc-2 . PLtetO-1. In all variants of the toggle switch,
the sequence of the three promoters is unchanged. The rates of
synthesis of the repressors (a1 and a2 in the model) or the reporter
genes are modiﬁed by exchanging the downstream ribosome bind-
ing sites (RBS). The promoter and RBS sequences and their relative
strengths are described in the Supplementary Information.

In all toggle plasmids, the gfpmut3 gene21 is arranged as the
second cistron downstream of the Ptrc-2 promoter. Thus, tran-
scription from Ptrc-2, and hence, repression of P1, results in the
expression of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)mut3. For clarity, this
state is termed the ‘high’ state. The opposing state, in which P1 is
transcribed and Ptrc-2 is repressed, is termed the ‘low’ state. Unless
otherwise indicated, gfpmut3 is the reporter used in all plasmids.

To investigate the conditions required for bistability, six variants
of the toggle switch (four pTAK plasmids and two pIKE plasmids)
were constructed by inserting RBS sequences of differing strengths
into the RBS1 site. All four pTAK plasmids exhibited bistability,
whereas only one pIKE plasmid (pIKE107) exhibited bistability. The
demonstration of bistability is illustrated in Fig. 4. In this experi-
ment, the toggle and control plasmids were grown in E. coli strain

JM2.300 for 23.5 h. At 6, 11 and 18 h, samples were washed and
diluted into fresh medium with or without inducers, as appropriate.
Cells were initially grown for 6 hours with 2 mM IPTG, inducing
GFPmut3 expression in all
toggles and the IPTG-inducible
pTAK102 control plasmid. Cells were grown for an additional 5 h
with no IPTG. The ﬁve bistable toggle plasmids, which had been
switched to the high state, continued to express GFPmut3 in the
absence of inducer, whereas the pTAK102 control plasmid and the
monostable pIKE105 toggle plasmid returned to the low state. Cells
were then grown at 42 8C (pTAK plasmids only) or grown in the
presence of 500 ng ml-1 aTc (pIKE plasmids only). After 7 h of
growth, GFPmut3 expression in all toggles was shut off, whereas
GFPmut3 expression in the thermally-inducible pTAK106 control
and the aTc-inducible pIKE108 control was activated. Cells were
returned to standard temperature (see Methods) with no inducers.
After an additional 5.5 h, the ﬁve bistable toggle plasmids remained
in the low state, whereas the pTAK106 and pIKE108 controls
returned, as expected, to their non-induced condition.

Figure 4c shows the long-term stability of the two states of the
pTAK117 toggle plasmid. In this experiment, a single culture of
pTAK117 cells (initially in the low state) was divided into two
cultures. The ﬁrst group was grown in medium with no inducers,
while the second group was grown in medium with 2 mM IPTG.
After 6 h, cells were washed and diluted into fresh medium with no
inducer. Both groups of cells were grown for an additional 22 h,
being sampled and diluted into fresh medium every 6–8.5 h. The
two groups of pTAK117 cells remained in their initial high or low
states for the entire 22 h.

Although all of the toggle plasmids contain the same conﬁgura-
tion of elements, one plasmid, pIKE105, does not exhibit bistability.
This result is probably due to the reduced efﬁciency of the Tet
repressor relative to the l repressor. To maintain bistability, the
reduced efﬁciency requires a corresponding decrease in the strength
of the PLtetO-1 promoter relative to the PLs1con promoter (see
Box 1). The PLtetO-1 promoter in the pIKE105 plasmid is not
sufﬁciently reduced in strength to achieve bistability. However, the
strength reduction provided by the PLtetO-1 promoter in the
pIKE107 plasmid is sufﬁcient.

A qualitative prediction of the toggle model is that a genetic
toggle will have nearly ideal switching thresholds. Induction by
IPTG, aTc or heat alters the dynamic balance between the compet-
ing promoters such that the toggle is pushed into a region of
monostability. The transition from bistability to monostability
occurs in a sharp, discontinuous fashion owing to the existence of
a bifurcation. This bifurcation occurs when one of the stable steady
states is annihilated by the unstable steady state.

The ideal threshold, or bifurcation, in the pTAK117 toggle switch
is illustrated both theoretically and experimentally in Fig. 5. In this
experiment, pTAK117 (initially in the low state) and pTAK102 (as a
control) were grown in 13 different concentrations of IPTG for 17 h

to steady state, being diluted twice (at 6 and 12.5 h) into fresh
medium with the same IPTG concentration. Induction of the
pTAK102 control has the familiar sigmoidal shape. In contrast,
the pTAK117 toggle follows the induction curve of pTAK102 up to
an IPTG concentration of 40 mM, at which point it crosses the
bifurcation and exhibits a quasi-discontinuous jump to the high
expression state. Owing to the natural ﬂuctuations in gene expres-
sion, the bifurcation is not a perfect discontinuity as predicted by
the deterministic toggle equations. The stochastic nature of gene
expression causes variability in the location of the switching thresh-
old and thus blurs the bifurcation point. Near the bifurcation, this
blurriness is realized as a bimodal distribution of cells (Fig. 5c).

The switching time of the pTAK117 plasmid from the low to the
high state and from the high to the low state is shown in Fig. 6. In
this experiment, pTAK117 cells in the low state were diluted in fresh
medium and induced with 2 mM IPTG. Separate cultures were
grown for 35 min to 6 h before being washed and diluted in fresh
medium with no inducer. Growth was continued until 10.25 h after
the start of the experiment and cells were assayed in the ﬂow
cytometer. Conversely, pTAK117 cells in the high state were diluted
in fresh medium with no inducer. Separate cultures were grown at
41 6 1 8C for 35 min to 6 h before being diluted in fresh medium
with no inducer. Growth was continued at standard temperature
until 10.25 h after the start of the experiment and cells were assayed
in the ﬂow cytometer.

As shown by the appearance of a bimodal distribution at 4 h
(Fig. 6), the pTAK117 plasmid begins switching to the high state
after 3–4 h of IPTG induction. By 5 h the switching is nearly
complete, and by 6 h it is complete. On the other hand, switching
from the high state to the low state is completed in 35 min or less.
The primary determinant of switching time is the rate of elimina-
tion of the repressor proteins. Switching from low to high requires

the gradual dilution, by cell growth, of the IPTG-bound Lac
repressor. On the other hand, switching from high to low is effected
by immediate thermal destabilization of the temperature-sensitive l
repressor. Thus, switching to the low state is substantially faster than
switching to the high state. Furthermore, the conﬁguration of the
pTAK117 plasmid—the rate of Lac repressor synthesis is more than
an order of magnitude higher than the rate of l repressor syn-
thesis—suggests that the low state is more stable than the high state.
Our approach to the construction of a genetic toggle switch
represents a signiﬁcant departure from traditional genetic engineer-
ing in that we rely primarily on the manipulation of network

Figure 5 Toggle switch induction threshold. a, Steady-state gene expression after 17-h
induction. The pTAK117 toggle plasmid (red circles) exhibits a quasi-discontinuous jump
to the high state whereas the pTAK102 control plasmid (blue triangles) exhibits a
sigmoidal induction curve. Point 1 is taken from separate experiments measuring the high
state of pTAK117 with no inducer. Points 3a and 3b are the high and low modes of a
bimodally distributed cell population. The bimodality occurs due to natural ﬂuctuations in
gene expression and the close proximity of the toggle switch to its bifurcation point.
Theoretical curves are calculated from equation (1) with the term u=(cid:133)1 (cid:135) (cid:137)IPTG(cid:138)=K (cid:134)h,
where K is the dissociation constant of IPTG from LacR and h is the cooperativity of IPTG
binding, replacing u in the denominator of equation (1b). The red curves show the stable
steady states and the orange curve shows the unstable steady state of the toggle. The blue
curve shows the steady state of the IPTG-inducible control plasmid. Model parameters for
the theoretical curves are a1 (cid:136) 156:25, a2 (cid:136) 15:6, b (cid:136) 2:5, g (cid:136) 1, h (cid:136) 2:0015,

architecture, rather than the engineering of proteins and other
regulatory elements, to obtain desired behaviours. In addition, the
reasonable agreement between the toggle theory and experiment
indicates that the theoretical design of complex and practical gene
networks is a realistic and achievable goal. Moreover, the genetic
toggle switch exempliﬁes a forward engineering approach to the
study of gene regulation in which synthetic gene circuits serve as
highly simpliﬁed, highly controlled models of natural gene net-
works. As a practical device, the toggle switch, which requires only
transient rather than sustained induction, may ﬁnd applications in
gene therapy and biotechnology. Finally, as a cellular memory unit,
the toggle forms the basis for ‘genetic applets’—self-contained,
programmable, synthetic gene circuits for the control of cell
function.

Methods
Numerics
All theoretical curves were calculated numerically from equation (1) (Box 1) using Matlab
(Mathworks), XPP-AUTO, software for simulation and analysis of differential equations
(G. B. Ermentrout, University of Pittsburgh, available at http://www.pitt.edu/,phase/), or
AUTO, a bifurcation package included in the XPP-AUTO software (E. Doedel, McGill
University).

Plasmid construction
Plasmids were constructed using basic molecular cloning techniques as described in
standard cloning manuals22,23. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs and
Promega; PfuTurbo polymerase was from Stratagene; all other enzymes were from New
England Biolabs; all synthetic oligonucleotides were from Operon Technologies. All genes,
promoters and transcription terminators were obtained by PCR ampliﬁcation using
PfuTurbo proofreading polymerase and synthetic primers with overhanging ends con-
taining the appropriate restriction sites. Ribosome binding sites were included in the
overhanging ends of the primers. Site mutations were performed using either Stratagene
QuickChange or ExSite.

Genes, promoters and transcription terminators were obtained as follows: Ptrc-2 from
pTrc99a (AP Biotech); PL from pXC46 (ATCC); pLtetO-1 by total synthesis according to
the published sequence20; lacI from pTrc99a; cIts from pGW7 (ATCC); tetR from pcDNA6/
TR (Invitrogen); gfpuv from pGFPuv (Clontech); gfpmut3 from pJBA111 (gift of J. B.
Andersen, Technical University of Denmark); and rrnT1T2 terminators from pTrc99a. All
plasmids contained the ampicillin resistance region and ColE1 and origin of replication
from the pTrc99a plasmid. All cloning was performed by TSS transformation22 into E. coli
strain JM2.300 (CGSC), JC158 (CGSC) or TAP106 (ATCC).

DNA sequencing was performed using a Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism 377 sequencer.

indicated in the text. All Type I and pIKE series plasmids were grown at 37 6 1 8C, unless
otherwise indicated. All pTAK series plasmids were grown at 32 6 1 8C except during
thermal induction. Thermal induction was carried out at 42 6 1 8C, unless otherwise
indicated. For all expression tests, cells were maintained in logarithmic growth phase by
periodic 500–1,000-fold dilution into fresh medium.

Ampicillin and IPTG were from Sigma. Anhydrotetracycline was from ACROS

Organics. All other chemicals were from Fisher.

Assay of gene expression
All expression data were collected using a Becton–Dickinson FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer
with a 488-nm argon excitation laser and a 515–545-nm emission ﬁlter. Before assay, cells
were pelleted and resuspended in 0.22 mm ﬁltered PBS (58 mM Na2HPO4, 17 mM
NaH2PO4, 68 mM NaCl, pH (cid:136) 7:4). Cells were assayed at low ﬂow rate and ﬂuorescence
was calibrated using InSpeck green ﬂuorescent beads (Molecular Probes). All measure-
ments of gene expression were obtained from three independent cultures maintained
simultaneously under identical conditions. For each culture, 40,000 events were collected.
All ﬂow data were converted to ASCII format using MFI (E. Martz, University of
Masachusetts, Amherst, available at http://marlin.bio.umass.edu/mcbfacs/ﬂowcat.
html#mﬁ) and analysed with Matlab.

Strains, growth conditions and chemicals
The host cell for all promoter assays and toggle switch experiments was E. coli strain
JM2.300 (l-, lacI22 rpsL135 (StrR), thi-1) (CGSC strain 5002). JM2.300, which contains
few mutations, is a fast-growing strain that can tolerate enormous overexpression of
plasmid-bound genes. Because JM2.300 contains no l repressor and carries a nonfunc-
tional Lac repressor (lacI22), it is an ideal host for the toggle switch.

All cells were grown in LB medium (Difco) with 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin plus inducers as
