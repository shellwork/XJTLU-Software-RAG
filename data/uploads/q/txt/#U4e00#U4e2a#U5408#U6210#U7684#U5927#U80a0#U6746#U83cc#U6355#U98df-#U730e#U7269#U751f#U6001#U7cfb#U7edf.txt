We have constructed a synthetic ecosystem consisting of two Escherichia coli populations, which
communicate bi-directionally through quorum sensing and regulate each other’s gene expression
and survival via engineered gene circuits. Our synthetic ecosystem resembles canonical predator–
prey systems in terms of logic and dynamics. The predator cells kill the prey by inducing expression
of a killer protein in the prey, while the prey rescue the predators by eliciting expression of an
antidote protein in the predator. Extinction, coexistence and oscillatory dynamics of the predator
and prey populations are possible depending on the operating conditions as experimentally
validated by long-term culturing of the system in microchemostats. A simple mathematical model
is developed to capture these system dynamics. Coherent interplay between experiments and
mathematical analysis enables exploration of the dynamics of interacting populations in a
predictable manner.

Introduction

Since its recent emergence, synthetic biology has shown great
for generating practically useful systems while
potential
serving as an approach to decoding biological
‘design
principles’ (Hasty et al, 2002; Sprinzak and Elowitz, 2005;
Andrianantoandro et al, 2006; Chang and Keasling, 2006;
Chin, 2006; Haseltine and Arnold, 2007). A key challenge in
this area is to identify general, scalable strategies that enable
construction of
increasingly complex gene circuits with
reliable performance, as well as to develop novel technological
platforms for quantitative circuit characterization (Simpson,
2004; Endy, 2005; Marguet et al, 2007). The predator–prey
ecosystem serves as an excellent model for such a challenge.
As an essential component of ecological dynamics, natural
predator–prey systems have been analyzed extensively by
modeling and experiments (May, 1974; Murray, 2002). In
comparison with other types of ecological interactions (e.g.
mutualism and competition), predation often generates richer

dynamics and as such represents a greater challenge to
engineer de novo. In this study, we constructed synthetic gene
circuits that converted two Escherichia coli populations into a
synthetic predator–prey system. Long-term quantiﬁcation of
the system dynamics, which required an improved version
(Supplementary Figure S1) of the recently developed micro-
chemostat (Balagadde et al, 2005), validated the designed
function. In addition to pushing the limits of programming and
characterization of complex cellular dynamics, our system can
serve as a model system to address questions arising from its
natural counterparts.

Results and discussion

As shown in Box 1A, two E. coli populations (‘predator’ and
‘prey’) communicate and regulate each other’s density
through quorum sensing (QS), a mechanism by which many
bacteria broadcast and respond to changes in their local

Box 1 A synthetic predator–prey ecosystem. (A) The system consists of two types of engineered bacteria controlling each other’s survival and death via two
different QS signals. Outer boxes represent cell walls. Arrows represent activation or production; blunt arrows represent inhibition or killing. CcdB (‘B’) is controlled
by Plac/ara-1 in the predator and PluxI in the prey. CcdA (‘A’) is controlled by PluxI. The lux system is shown in blue and the las system in green. The QS genes in the
predator are controlled by PLtetO-1, and those in the prey by Plac/ara-1. Filled circles represent 3OC6HSL and ﬁlled diamonds represent 3OC12HSL. The predator–
prey interaction is activated by IPTG. See main text and Supplementary information for more details. (B) Bifurcation analysis of the model in terms of the killing

population density (Camilli and Bassler, 2006). Two QS
modules, LuxI/LuxR from Vibrio ﬁscheri and LasI/LasR
from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are used to enable two-way
communication between the predator and prey populations.
When the prey density is low, the predator cells die due to
constitutive expression of a suicide gene (ccdB). In prey cells
an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), 3OC6HSL, is synthesized
by LuxI. As the prey density increases, 3OC6HSL accumulates
in the culture and, at sufﬁciently high concentrations, it is
bound by the transcriptional regulator LuxR in the predator
cells leading to increased expression of an antidote gene (ccdA)
to rescue the predators. The predator cells in turn produce
another AHL, 3OC12HSL by LasI that permeates into the prey
cells where it is bound by LasR, which activates expression of
the killer ccdB gene, inducing ‘predation.’ This system satisﬁes
the broader deﬁnition of predation for a two-species ecosys-
tem, where one species (prey) suffers from the growth of the
second (predator) and the latter beneﬁts from the growth
of the former (Taylor, 1984). However, it differs from the
canonical predator–prey system in two aspects. First, instead

of acting as a food source, the prey provides an ‘antidote’ to
programmed death of the predator. Second, there is competi-
tion between predator and prey for nutrients in a co-culture,
which is generally absent in natural predator–prey systems.

We employed ordinary differential equations to model the
major kinetic events during the functioning of this circuit (see
Supplementary information and Figure S5 for details). The
model predicts extinction, coexistence or oscillatory dynamics
(Box 1B) depending on rates of cell growth, cell death
controlled by AHL, as well as production and degradation of
AHL. According to bifurcation analysis (Box 1B, left panel),
the larger the CcdB killing rate constant (dc1), the higher
the likelihood of robust oscillatory behavior:
increasing
dc1 signiﬁcantly broadens the parameter region that gives rise
to oscillation (region bound by the loci of Hopf bifurca-
tion points). Our experiments indicated that the original
LacZa-CcdB fusion protein, which was used in our population
control circuit (You et al, 2004), might lack the necessary
toxicity (data not shown). To overcome this limitation, we
constructed a new LacZa0-CcdB protein by deleting 32 amino

Individual growth behaviors (without interactions) of (A) predator and

chloramphenicol and kanamycin was inoculated with a single bacterial colony
and was divided into three 2 ml cultures: ‘OFF’ cultures contained no inducers,
‘þ IPTG’ cultures contained 1 mM IPTG and ‘þ IPTGþ AHL’ contained 1 mM
IPTG and 100 nM AHL, respectively. After 20 h of incubation (light gray bars),

acids in LacZa, which resulted in an eight-fold increase in
potency compared to the full-length protein (Supplementary
Figure S2). The LacZa0-CcdB fusion protein is referred to as
‘CcdB’ in this paper.

It was previously shown that both active LasR and active
LuxR can initiate gene expression at the luxI promoter (PluxI)
(Gray et al, 1994) (Supplementary Figure S3). Therefore, we
used PluxI to drive both the ccdA gene in the predator cells
(regulated by LuxR) and the ccdB gene in the prey cells
(regulated by LasR). To expedite rescue of the predator by its
survival signal (3OC6HSL), the corresponding QS system was
placed under the control of PLtetO-1 promoter (Lutz and Bujard,
1997), which is constitutively active in the MG1655 E. coli
strain. This strategy simultaneously accelerates 3OC12HSL
synthesis and thus prey killing. To ensure sufﬁcient killing of
the predator, we implemented the CcdB induction circuits in a
high-copy-number plasmid (p15A origin of replication with a
copy number of B20 per cell). This synthetic ecosystem is
activated by isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG),
which induces ccdB expression in the predator and the QS
system in the prey. To optimize protein expression levels and
synchronize the timing of the circuit components, we tested
many combinations of promoters, origins of replication
and bacterial host strains, and narrowed our focus to one
conﬁguration (Supplementary Figure S4A). Unless noted
otherwise, the predator circuit was implemented in the E. coli
strain MG1655, the prey circuit in the strain Top10F0. Finally, a
destabilized green ﬂuorescent protein gene (gfpuv-lva) was
introduced into the predator (Supplementary Figure S4A) to
capture dynamic changes and differentiate the predator from
the prey cell populations in mixed cultures.

We veriﬁed the basic function of each population indepen-
dently using IPTG and the corresponding AHL supplied
exogenously (Figure 1). In the OFF culture containing neither
IPTG nor 3OC6HSL, predator cells grew to a relatively high
density in LBK medium (Figure 1A). Growth was signiﬁcantly
inhibited in the ON culture containing 1 mM of IPTG, which
fully induced ccdB expression. However, predator cells
induced with IPTG were rescued by 3OC6HSL (100 nM), which
when bound by LuxR can initiate ccdA expression. Rescued
predators (with IPTG and 3OC6HSL) grew slightly slower than
those in the OFF condition (Figure 1A), possibly due to the

metabolic burden involved in expression of circuit compo-
nents, incomplete neutralization of CcdB by CcdA, or both. As
shown in Figure 1B, prey cells were able to grow in the OFF
culture (without inducers) as well as medium containing only
IPTG but perished when both IPTG and 3OC12HSL were
present. The IPTG-induced prey population grew slower
compared to that of the OFF culture. This minor growth
retardation could be a result of the metabolic burden of the
circuit components, basal
level CcdB expression due to
crosstalk between 3OC6HSL and LasR, or both.

This synthetic predator–prey system represents one of the
most complicated synthetic circuits reported to date. Long-
term characterization of such circuits, which is essential to the
veriﬁcation of
the designed dynamics, presents a major
technological challenge. Measurement of circuit performance
in conventional macroscopic (test tube) cultures hinted at
oscillatory dynamics (data not shown). But
insufﬁcient
temporal resolution due to the arduous and time-consuming
process involved in acquiring such data made these observa-
tions inconclusive. In addition, the short-lived stability of the
circuit in the macro-sized populations (Desai et al, 2007) could
only provide a ﬂeeting glimpse of the programmed behavior:
function was lost before the circuit behavior could be
appreciably observed. To this end, we resorted to a recently
developed microchemostat platform (Balagadde et al, 2005); a
high-throughput screening technology that can inexpensively
perform rapid characterization of synthetic circuits under a
matrix of conditions with unprecedented capabilities includ-
ing long-term, non-invasive measurements of microbial
population properties under steady-state conditions with
single cell resolution and advanced automation. Equally
important,
the microchemostat’s micro-sized population
(B102–104 cells versus at least B109 in macroscale cultures)
reduces the number of cell division events per unit time and
hence slows down microbial evolution (Desai et al, 2007).
This aspect facilitates monitoring of programmed behavior
of bacterial populations for hundreds of hours despite
strong selection pressure to evade population control
(Balagadde et al, 2005).

(Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, we reduced reactor
volume from B16 to B9 nl to further reduce the bacterial
population size in each reactor, which has been shown to help
stabilize a population controller during long-term culturing
(Balagadde et al, 2005). This strategy also allowed us to
increase the number of parallel reactors per chip from 6–14 for
higher throughput.

Figure 2A illustrates the typical oscillatory dynamics of
predator and prey populations in the microchemostat with a
period of B180 h (IPTG¼5 mM, dilution rate (D)¼0.1125 h
 1).
Initially, when the prey density was low, predator growth was
inhibited due to constitutive expression of CcdB. Conversely,
the prey grew to a high density (B35 000 cells per reactor) in
B10 h. The high prey density led to rescue of the predator
population, which recovered from B5000 cells per reactor to
420 000 cells per reactor in B10 h. The increased predator
density in turn resulted in killing of the prey cells, leading to a

drastic reduction in the prey density (from B35 000 cells per
reactor to just a few cells per reactor). The decrease in the prey
density led to insufﬁcient rescue of predator cells and the
subsequent decline in predator density at B35 h. The prey
population recovered B10 h later. In summary, the system
yielded oscillatory dynamics between the predator and prey
populations that clearly resemble those observed in natural
predator–prey ecosystems.

The parallel design of microchemostat reactors greatly
facilitates the investigation of circuit response to changing
circuit parameters. Figure 2B illustrates a typical set of
dynamics of the synthetic predator–prey ecosystem for various
circuit induction levels. Without induction (IPTG¼0), predator
and prey had negligible circuit-driven interactions. Since the
predator (MG1655 strain) grows faster than the prey (Top10F0
strain), the prey population was eventually (after B50 h)
driven to extinction (the ﬂuctuations of the prey density
around 0 cell per reactor were numerical artifacts of imaging
processing; see Supplementary information for details). High-
er IPTG levels (X5 mM) did elicit oscillatory dynamics between
the predator and the prey populations.

These results suggest the crossing of a Hopf bifurcation
point using the IPTG level as the control parameter (also see
Supplementary Figures S6 and S7A). This aspect is illustrated

with bifurcation analysis (Figure 2C) that accounts for the
effects of IPTG on 3OC6HSL production by the prey and CcdB
expression by the predator. At sufﬁciently low IPTG levels,
there is minimal programmed predation between two popula-
tions and the primary interaction is competition. As a result,
the predator population dominates due to its growth advan-
tage, leading to the washout of the prey. Increasing IPTG
beyond a critical level enables crossing of a Hopf bifurcation
point and elicits oscillatory dynamics.

inset). Second,

The model further predicts two salient features of the
predator behavior at high IPTG induction levels. First, the
response dynamics are much slower compared to those at low
IPTG induction levels (Figure 2C,
these
dynamics involve minimal predator densities that are close
to zero. Both aspects are qualitatively consistent with
experimental data (top panels of Figure 2B; Supplementary
Figure S7A), although the data do not exclude the possibility
that the system may eventually approach steady state. Because
of the miniaturized volume of the microchemostat reactor
(B9 nl), the predator (or prey) population is prone to falling
below the detection limit (B75 cells per reactor) during an
oscillation trough (Figure 2B, row 1, columns 1 and 2; from
B10 to B80 h) and in severe cases, getting washed out
(Figure 2B, row 1, column 3).

experimental observations that an increase in the dilution rate
can lead to a signiﬁcant decrease in the period of oscillations
(Figure 3C, inset). Simulations further show that an increase in
D can shift a slow, sustained oscillation (Figure 3C, bottom left

(Figure 3C, bottom right panel).

These modeling results qualitatively account for the experi-
mental observations of the dependence of systems dynamics
on dilution rate. We note that the system’s response to a shift in
D is highly sensitive to the prevailing conditions of operation.

 1, the system either

exhibits a damped oscillation or approaches a steady state (the
third row, Supplementary Figure S7A, where IPTG¼50 mM).
The sensitivity of the damped oscillation to perturbations of a
parameter or initial conditions can qualitatively explain this
phenomenon (Supplementary Figure S7C,
insets). Since
damped oscillations are transient dynamics, small variations
in the control of the microchemostat dilution rate or different
initial phases of
the predator and prey populations can
signiﬁcantly impact the oscillation behavior.

Drawing inspiration from the nature, synthetic biologists
have created circuits that operate in single cells (Elowitz and
Leibler, 2000; Gardner et al, 2000; Atkinson et al, 2003; Fung
et al, 2005; Levskaya et al, 2005), in individual populations
(Kobayashi et al, 2004; You et al, 2004; Basu et al, 2005;
Anderson et al, 2006) and between populations (Brenner et al,
2007). Our study represents a major advance beyond recent
efforts in constructing synthetic ecosystems (Shou et al, 2007;
Weber et al, 2007),
in terms of system complexity and
resolution of characterization. It provides a framework for
exploring how naturally existing cellular components can be
assembled to program and coordinate highly complex cellular
behavior. In addition, synthetic ecosystems such as ours may
serve as well-deﬁned systems for exploring evolutionary and

ecological questions regarding, for example, the generation
and maintenance of biodiversity (Chesson, 2000; Nowak and
Sigmund, 2004). Conventionally, typical experiments invol-
ving microorganism systems are limited to using nutrient
concentration and dilution rate as the sole control parameters
(Fussmann et al, 2000; Becks et al, 2005). In comparison, our
system allows direct manipulation of intrinsic parameters,
such as growth rate, death rate and strength of cell–cell
communication. In this system, there is a clear and explicit
mapping between the genetic constructs and the correspond-
ing population dynamics, which may facilitate future studies
of how molecular interactions are manifested in the temporal
patterns of population dynamics, a central theme in ecology
(Bohannan and Lenski, 2000; Foster et al, 2007). The generic
nature of our system design makes it portable to other
ecological
including mutualism, competition,
commensalism and amensalism (May, 1974). The virtually
unlimited conﬁgurations that are possible with these basic
elements will allow us to further examine the interplay
between the environment, gene regulation and population
dynamics. With additional control over population mixing or
segregation, it will be possible to program bacterial popula-
tions to mimic development and differentiation in multi-
cellular organisms.

Mircochemostat design and fabrication
Microchemostat chips were fabricated out of silicone elastomer
polydimethylsiloxane (General Electric RTV 615) using multi-layer
soft lithography as described previously (Balagadde et al, 2005). In this
chip version, the number of reactors per chip was increased from 6 to
14. In addition, a relatively thin imaging section 3 mm high (compared
to B10 mm high otherwise) was incorporated along a 150 mm stretch of
the growth loop to constrain the entire ﬂuorescent signal of the cells
within a single focal plane (Supplementary Figure S1).

The microchemostat reader
The general assembly of
the reader was described previously
(Balagadde et al, 2005). The cells in the microchemostat were imaged
through bright-ﬁeld or ﬂuorescence microscopy. Illumination in each
case was synchronized to chip operation using two electronic shutters
(Uniblitz electronic shutters; AG Heinz Inc., Lake Forest, CA, USA).
Fluorescent and phase-contrast digital images were captured using a
cooled charge coupled device camera (monochrome Retiga SRV 2000
RV from QImaging Corporation). Labview software was used to
control the synchronized operation of these components and all chip
operation.

Microscopic cell counting
Within the 3 mm height of the imaging section (compared to the 10 mm
height otherwise), imaged cells were constrained into a sufﬁciently
thin horizontal plane so that they could all be in focus simultaneously.
This also enhanced the single-cell resolvability by decreasing the
cell–cell overlap in the horizontal plane (Supplementary Figure S1).

The total number of cells in each continuous reactor was
determined directly through automated bright-ﬁeld microscopy by
counting the number of cells present in a growth chamber section of
known volume. Typically, a set of eight phase-contrast images was
taken at
the imaging section of each reactor via bright-ﬁeld
microscopy, with rotary mixing of the culture in between consecutive
snapshots. Image-processing algorithms in Matlab were used to
determine the average number of cells in each picture set, from which

the total cell count was determined as described previously (Balagadde
et al, 2005).

To determine community composition of mixed populations, one of
the species (predator or prey) was tagged with a Gfpuv ﬂuorescent
label. The ﬂuorescent signal was determined by directly counting the
ﬂuorescent cells in a set of typically four images acquired through
automated ﬂuorescence microscopy, using the appropriate Gfpuv ﬁlter
set: excitation 395/40 and emission 510/40. Thus, the non-ﬂuorescent
density, obtained by subtracting the ﬂuorescent from the total cell
count, represented the density of the second population. According to
this approach, members of a ‘ﬂuorescent’ species that are not bright
enough to be captured by the image-processing algorithms get counted
as non-ﬂuorescent species cells. This could be a source of noise in the
number of cells reported for each species. In the future, this problem
could be addressed by assigning a different ﬂuorescent marker to each
species involved in the experiment.

A motorized stage system (Prior Scientiﬁc, Rockland, MA, USA)
enabled simultaneous documentation of multiple microchemostat
experiments that operated in parallel on a single chip.

Plasmids
Plasmids used for this study are shown in Supplementary Figure S4. To
construct placCcdBs (p15A origin, KanR), 96 base pairs between two
NstI sites in the coding region of LacZa-CcdB (pZErO-2) were deleted,
and the resulting gene lacZa0-ccdB, along with its upstream lac
promoter, was cloned into pPROLar.A122 (BD Biosciences Clontech).
ptetLuxRLasI-luxCcdA (SC101 origin, CmR) was constructed in several
steps. First, the lasI gene along with its ribosome-binding site was
cloned from the P. aeruginosa (PAO1) chromosome into plasmid
pLuxR (Collins et al, 2005), where it was placed downstream of the
luxR gene. Second, the luxR-lasI cassette was cloned into plasmid
pPROTet.E132 (Clontech) to generate ptetLuxRLasI, where the cassette
is under control of a PLtetO-1 promoter (Lutz and Bujard, 1997). Next,
the ccdA gene was cloned from the F plasmid, PCR-fused with a PluxI
promoter from pluxGFPuv (Collins et al, 2005), and inserted into
ptetLuxRLasI, in opposite direction from the PLtetO-1-lasR-lasI cassette.
Finally, the ColE1 replication origin of this plasmid was replaced with
the SC101 origin, which was cloned from the repressilator plasmid
(Elowitz and Leibler, 2000). pLasRLuxI-luxCcdBs (p15A origin, KanR)
was also constructed in several steps. First, the lasR gene was cloned
from the P. aeruginosa (PAO1) chromosome into pPROLar.A122
(Clontech) placing it under control of the Plac/ara-1 promoter to
generate pLasR. Second, the luxI gene was cloned from plasmid pSND-
1 (Weiss and Knight, 2000) into pLasR where it was positioned directly
downstream of the lasR gene, generating pLasRLuxI. Third, a pluxI-
lacZa0-ccdB cassette was cloned from plasmid pluxCcdBs, which was
derived from pluxCcdB by removing 96 base pairs between two NstI
sites (see above).

Plasmid ptetGFPuv (LVA) (ColE1 origin, CmR) was constructed by
inserting an N-terminal portion of GFPuv ampliﬁed by PCR with a
primer, including a KpnI site upstream of the start codon and a primer
annealing to the internal AvaII site, and a C-terminal portion of GFPuv
(LVA) ampliﬁed by PCR from pINV-4 (Weiss, 2001) with a primer
annealing to the internal AvaII site and a primer including BamHI
downstream of the LVA tag into KpnI- and BamHI-digested pPRO-
Tet.E132 (BD Biosciences Clontech).

Strains, growth conditions and macro-scale data
acquisition
MG1655 and Top10F0 E. coli cell strains (Invitrogen) were used unless
otherwise noted. For IPTG/AHL response tests in Figure 1, we used
3OC6HSL (Sigma Aldrich) and 3OC12HSL synthesized by E Toone
(Department of Chemistry, Duke University), which were prepared
and stored as reference (Collins et al, 2005).

PH-buffered LBK media (containing 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract
 1) were used for liquid culture. The media were buffered
and 7 g KCl l
with 100 mM weak acids (PIPES was used for pH 6.2 and 6.6, and
MOPS for pH 7.0), and pH was adjusted by adding 5 M KOH.

and anhydrotetracycline were added. IPTG plus 0.05% arabinose
(1 mM) was used to activate the circuit. Cultures were shaken in a
12 ml culture tube at 371C and 250 r.p.m. A starter culture of the
predator cells or the prey cells was inoculated from a single colony and
grown separately for at least 10 h, and then diluted 1000-fold into 4 ml
of fresh medium.

Microchemostat medium, preculture preparation
and growth conditions
LBK medium was used in all microchemostat experiments unless
otherwise stated. Predator and prey populations were independently
tested for circuit function according to the procedure illustrated in
Figure 1. Glycerol stock solutions (30 ml) were created using the tested
predator and prey cultures and were placed in a  801C freezer for long-
term storage. These mini-stocks were used to prepare pre-cultures for
subsequent microchemostat experiments.

Precultures were prepared by inoculating a 2 ml sterile medium
sample with 10 ml of previously prepared mini-glycerol stock cell
solution and shaking at 280 r.p.m. for B9 h at 371C (VWR bench top
incubator, model 1575R). The precultures were then used to seed
 1. To measure predator–
microchemostat reactors with B20 cells nl
prey circuit dynamics in the microchemostat, cells were grown in pH
7.0-buffered LBK medium. All microchemostat media were supple-
