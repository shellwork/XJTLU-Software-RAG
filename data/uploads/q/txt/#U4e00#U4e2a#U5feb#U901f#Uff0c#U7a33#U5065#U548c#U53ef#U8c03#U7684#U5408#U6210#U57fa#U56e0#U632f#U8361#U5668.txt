A fast, robust and tunable synthetic gene oscillator

One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of
engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of
gene-regulatory networks according to ‘design specifications’
generated from computational modelling1–6. This approach pro-
vides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory
network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fun-
damental gene circuits have been developed using this approach,
including toggle switches7 and oscillators8–10, and these have been
applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development11
and cellular population control12. Here we describe an engineered
genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and per-
sistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The
oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network
architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback
loops1,13. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell
microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and
monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles.
Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of
oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited
large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation
runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer
levels, temperature and the media source. Computational model-
ling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a
robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop,
which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular pro-
cesses involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The
positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations
and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined
model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design
without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain
confirming this computational prediction.

The synthetic gene oscillator is based on a previously reported
theoretical design1 and was constructed using E. coli components
(Fig. 1a). The hybrid promoter (plac/ara-1; ref. 14) is composed of
the activation operator site from the araBAD promoter placed in
its normal location relative to the transcription start site, and repres-
sion operator sites from the lacZYA promoter placed both upstream
and immediately downstream of the transcription start site. It is
activated by the AraC protein in the presence of arabinose and
repressed by the LacI protein in the absence of isopropyl b-D-1-thio-
galactopyranoside (IPTG). We placed the araC, lacI and yemGFP
(monomeric yeast-enhanced green fluorescent protein) genes under
the control of three identical copies of plac/ara-1 to form three co-
regulated
Infor-
mation). Hence, activation of the promoters by the addition of ara-
binose and IPTG to the medium results in transcription of each
component of the circuit, and increased production of AraC in the
presence of arabinose results in a positive feedback loop that
increases promoter activity. However, the concurrent increase in
production of LacI results in a linked negative feedback loop that

decreases promoter activity, and the differential activity of the two
feedback loops can drive oscillatory behaviour1,13.

The oscillator cells (denoted JS011) exhibited ubiquitous fluor-
escence oscillations over the entire run time of each experiment (at
least 4 h). For example, at 0.7% arabinose and 2 mM IPTG, more

than 99% of the cells showed oscillations with a period of approxi-
mately 40 min (Fig. 1b, g, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary
Movie 1). The highly dynamic nature of the oscillator components is
shown by the rapid decay of green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal,
which drops from peak to trough in less than 10 min (Fig. 1b). The
oscillatory phase was heritable between daughter cells, which resulted
in synchronized oscillations in areas of the microcolony derived from
a common cell. This synchrony was limited to a few periods, pre-
sumably owing to oscillatory phase diffusion. We used a microfluidic
device with a laminar boundary switch upstream of the growth
chamber to investigate the initiation of synchronized oscillations
(Supplementary Fig. 2c, d). Cells grown in the absence of inducer
initiated oscillations in a synchronous manner on the addition of
inducer (Supplementary Movie 10), which suggested the possibility
of using flow cytometry to characterize the oscillator further. Flow
cytometry of samples continuously collected from a culture in loga-
rithmic growth that had been induced with 0.7% arabinose and
2 mM IPTG showed oscillations
fluorescence
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Induction of oscillation was very quick (less
than 5 min) and initially well-synchronized. The amplitude of these
bulk oscillations decayed as the experiment progressed, as expected
from the desynchronization of
individual cells in the colony
(Supplementary Information). However, the period obtained from
the flow cytometry method (green data points in all figures) com-
pared favourably to that obtained from single cells using microscopy
(red data points in all figures).

in mean cell

The oscillator was extremely robust over an extensive range of
inducer conditions and temperatures. At 0.7% arabinose and 37 uC,
almost every observed cell oscillated (Supplementary Table 1) at all
IPTG concentrations examined (Fig. 1b–h and Supplementary
Movies 1–8). Varying the IPTG concentration allowed for the tuning
of the oscillator period (Fig. 2a), particularly at low IPTG concentra-
tions. The period decreased at high IPTG concentrations, and sub-
sequent characterization of the promoter revealed that this non-
monotonic behaviour is probably caused by IPTG interference with
AraC activation15 (Supplementary Information). The cell doubling
time on the microfluidic device remained largely steady between
experiments, ranging from 22.3 min to 27.6 min at 37 uC and showing
little correlation to IPTG concentration (R2 5 0.132). Individual cell
fluorescence trajectories showed a gradual increase in oscillatory

period as the cells were imaged on the microfluidic device (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4). This increase was not seen in doubling times, imply-
ing that the cells were not experiencing nutritional difficulties
or environmental stress that might cause an alteration in oscillator
behaviour.

To explore further the robustness of the oscillator, we investigated
the effect of varying arabinose, temperature and the media source. At a
fixed value of 2 mM IPTG and at 37 uC, the oscillatory period can be
tuned from 13 min to 58 min by varying the arabinose level from 0.1%
to 3.0% (Fig. 2b). Cells grown in the absence of arabinose did not
express measurable levels of GFP in single-cell microscopy or flow
cytometry experiments, and high levels of arabinose seemed to saturate
the system. We observed sustained oscillations at a range of tempera-
tures from 25 uC to 37 uC, with a decreasing period as a function of
temperature (Fig. 2c). The cell doubling time also decreased with
temperature, as expected, and the oscillatory period increased mono-
tonically with cell doubling time (Fig. 2d). The oscillator also func-
tioned in minimal A medium with 2 g l21 glucose (Fig. 2c, d).
Although the cell doubling time in minimal medium was significantly
longer than in LB-Miller formulation lysogeny broth (LB) (80–90 min
versus 22–24 min at 37 uC), the period in the minimal medium was
very similar to that in LB (Fig. 2c, d). This result, together with the
strong dependence of the period on IPTG and arabinose concentration
(at constant cellular doubling times), demonstrates that the synthetic
oscillator is not strongly coupled to the cell cycle. The similar depend-
ence of the period and the doubling time on the temperature seems to
be due to the thermodynamic change of the rate constants affecting all
cellular processes.

The oscillator was constructed according to design principles deter-
mined from previous theoretical work1. However, we found that this
original model failed to describe two important aspects of the experi-
ments. First, the model could not describe the observed functional
dependence of the period on inducer levels. Second, and perhaps most
importantly, because careful parameter tuning was necessary for
oscillations in the original model, it was not able to describe the robust
behaviour demonstrated in the experiments. This suggests that only a
small region of inducer space should support oscillations, in contrast
to the robust behaviour demonstrated in the experiments. These
shortcomings forced a re-evaluation of the derivation of the oscilla-
tor equations, and led to a new computational model that more
accurately described the experimental observations. The new model
incorporates the same coupled positive and negative feedback archi-
tecture, but includes details that were omitted from the previous
model. In particular, we found that directly modelling processes such
as protein–DNA binding, multimerization, translation, DNA loop-
ing, enzymatic degradation and protein folding greatly increased the
accuracy of the model. The result is a computational model that is very
robust to parameter variations and correctly describes the dynamics
of the oscillator for a large range of IPTG and arabinose concentra-
tions (see Box 1 and Supplementary Information).

In examining our refined model, we discovered another region in
parameter space that would support oscillatory behaviour. Our
model predicted that a constantly activated system with repression
controlled by a negative feedback loop could produce oscillations in
the absence of positive feedback (Supplementary Fig. 19). It has been
proposed that negative feedback gene networks can oscillate as long
as there is delay in the feedback16,17, and, although there is no explicit
delay in our model, the intermediate steps of translation, protein
folding and multimerization of LacI provide an effective form of
delay18 that is sufficient to support oscillations. We constructed this
system (denoted JS013) in E. coli using a hybrid promoter, pLlacO-1
(ref. 14), that is activated in the absence of LacI (or presence of IPTG)
to drive both lacI and yemGFP expression (Fig. 3a). We observed
oscillations in these cells when examined by single-cell microscopy
under inducing conditions (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 5 and
Supplementary Movie 11). These oscillations were not as distinct
or regular as in the dual-feedback oscillator, and they did not always

Box 1 | Dynamic modelling of the dual-feedback oscillator circuit
We used standard techniques to construct both stochastic and
deterministic computational models3,25–28 based on the same
underlying biochemical reactions illustrated in Fig. 4a (see
Supplementary Information for full details of modelling). Although the
interaction between transcription factors and the DNA is generally
quite complicated to model in detail29, we used experimental induction
curves to calibrate the induction levels in the reactions describing the
network (Supplementary Fig. 10). Over many oscillatory cycles, the
deterministic simulations were then shown to give accurately the
temporal evolution of the mode of the distributions generated by the
exact stochastic simulations24. Representative time series for the
protein concentrations obtained from the stochastic and deterministic
models are depicted in Fig. 4b, c. The models are very robust in that
oscillatory behaviour exists for a large range of parameter values and
network details (Supplementary Information). Importantly, we found
excellent quantitative agreement with the experimentally obtained
period as a function of inducer levels (Fig. 4d, e).

The amplitude and period of the oscillations as a function of inducer
levels can be conceptually explained using Fig. 4c. A burst begins with
the basal transcription of messenger RNA from both promoters,
encoding both the activator and the repressor. After a short delay
(caused by, for example, translation, protein folding and
multimerization), the amount of functional activator rises quicker than
the amount of functional repressor, as shown in Fig. 4b. This occurs for
two reasons. First, the activator gene is on a higher copy number
plasmid than the repressor gene, meaning that more activator
transcripts are produced than repressor transcripts. Second, assuming
that transcription and translation of the monomeric forms of both
proteins occur at similar rates, the activator will be more abundant
because the functional tetrameric form of LacI requires twice as many
monomers as does the functional dimeric form of AraC. As AraC levels
rise, an activation burst in production of mRNA occurs due to the
positive feedback loop. After LacI has been converted to a sufficient
number of tetramers, the production of mRNA is turned off and the
proteins decay enzymatically. Once all proteins have decayed, the
promoters are freed of all bound regulators and the cycle begins anew.
The length of the period is primarily determined by the time required
for the proteins to decay. Therefore, the period is dependent on the rate
of enzymatic decay and the magnitude of the activation burst.
Furthermore, because the burst size depends on the induction
characteristics of the promoter, it follows that the period is roughly
proportional to the induction level of the promoter.

return to a dim state, consistent with the predictions of the computa-
tional model. Furthermore, the period was largely unaffected by
IPTG concentration (varying less than 5% over three experimental
runs from 0.6 mM to 20 mM IPTG), suggesting that the addition of
the positive feedback loop serves the dual role of regularizing oscilla-
tions and allowing tunability of the period (see Supplementary
Information).

In the context of synthetic biology, our findings indicate that cau-
tion must be exercised when making simplifying assumptions in the

design of engineered gene circuits. We found that a full model of the
system that takes into account intermediate steps such as multimeri-
zation, translation, protein folding and DNA looping is essential. The
reason for this lies not only in the timescales of the system but also in
the sequential timing of events. Because the intermediate steps in the
production of functional protein take time, their introduction into the
model creates an important form of delay18–20. We found that this
effective delay greatly increases the robustness of our model. For
instance, oscillatory activity in the model is only somewhat sensitive

in the present context of a fast, robust and tunable oscillator sets the

coordinate intracellular behaviour, and reverse-engineering plat-
forms21 that measure the global response of the genome to an oscil-

METHODS SUMMARY
The dual-feedback oscillator circuit was constructed by placing araC, lacI and
yemGFP under the control of the hybrid plac/ara-1 promoter14 in three separate
transcriptional cassettes. An ssrA degradation tag22 was added to each gene to
decrease protein lifetime and to increase temporal resolution. These transcrip-
tional cassettes were placed on two modular plasmids14 and co-transformed into
an DaraC DlacI E. coli strain. The negative feedback oscillator circuit was con-
structed by placing ssrA-tagged lacI and yemGFP under the control of the pLlacO-1
promoter14 in two separate transcriptional cassettes, which were incorporated
onto two modular plasmids and co-transformed into a DlacI strain. Cells were

grown either in LB medium or in minimal A medium with 2 g l21 glucose.
Oscillations were induced using arabinose (0.1–3%) and IPTG (0–30 mM).
Single-cell microscopic data were collected by loading induced cells into
polydimethylsiloxane-based microfluidic platforms that constrained the cells
to a monolayer while supplying them with nutrients23, and then providing a
constant source of medium and inducers and imaging GFP fluorescence every
2–3 min for at least 4–6 h. These data were further analysed using ImageJ and
custom-written Matlab scripts to extract single-cell fluorescence trajectories.
Flow cytometry was performed either by taking samples from a continuously
grown and serially diluted culture or by growing multiple cultures in parallel for
varying durations. In either case, samples were read directly from their growth
medium and low-scatter noise was removed by thresholding. Flow cytometry
oscillatory periods were defined as the time elapsed between the first and second
fluorescence peaks. Details of
the models discussed are presented in
Supplementary Information. Stochastic simulations were performed using
Gillespie’s algorithm24, and deterministic simulations were performed using
custom Matlab scripts.

mutations. These tagged genes were then cloned into pZ modular plasmids under
the transcriptional control of the plac/ara-1 hybrid promoter14 to form three co-
regulated transcriptional modules with identical promoters, ribosome-binding
sequences and downstream terminators. The plac/ara-1 promoter is activated by
AraC in the presence of arabinose and repressed by LacI in the absence of IPTG.
The activator araC module and the reporter yemGFP module were placed on a
ColE1 plasmid, and the repressor module was placed on a p15A plasmid. All PCR-
amplified sections and sequence junctions were confirmed by sequencing. (See
Supplementary Fig. 1.) An DaraC DlacI strain was constructed by P1vir phage
transduction between DaraC and DlacI strains. The two plasmids described above
were co-transformed into this strain to construct the dual-feedback oscillator strain.
To construct the negative feedback oscillator strain, the hybrid promoter
pLlacO-1 (ref. 14) was used to regulate expression of lacI and yemGFP. This
promoter is repressed by LacI in the absence of IPTG. Both genes were tagged
with ssrA tags as described above. Two transcriptional modules containing
pLlacO-1 and lacI or yemGFP were constructed as above. The repressor module
was placed on a p15A plasmid and the reporter module was placed on a ColE1
plasmid. These were then co-transformed into a DlacI strain.
Microscopy. We examined cells with single-cell time-lapse fluorescence micro-
scopy using microfluidic devices designed to support growth of a monolayer of
E. coli cells under constant nutrient flow (Supplementary Fig. 2). The design of
the microfluidic device used in all microscopy experiments was adapted from the
Tesla microchemostat design23
cerevisiae.
Modifications made to support imaging monolayers of E. coli included lowering
the cell chamber height to match the cylindrical diameter of K-12 MG 1655 cells,
lowering the delivery channel height to maintain equivalent flow splitting
between the cell chamber and the bypass channel, and dividing the cell trapping
region into three channels for simultaneous observation of isolated colonies
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). For on-chip induction experiments, we used a vari-
ant of this device that incorporated a laminar boundary media switch into the
design30 and supported cell growth for several generations in non-inducing
media before induction and imaging (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d).

for use with Saccharomyces

In each experiment, a microfluidic device was mounted to the stage and wetted
using a solution of 0.1% Tween 20 surfactant in the appropriate growth medium.
For optimal E. coli growth, the chip temperature was typically maintained at 37 uC

by flowing heated water through deep thermal channels fabricated into the device.
Cells that had been passed from an overnight culture into inducing media
approximately 3–4 h earlier were loaded into the device from the cell port by
directing high flow both from the cell port and from the media port to the waste
port. On trapping a single cell in each channel, flow past the cell chamber was
reversed and slowed to 1–2 mm s21 such that fresh nutrients were delivered from
the media port by means of a combination of diffusion and advection without
physically disturbing the cells.

Cells grew logarithmically to fill the channels over an experimental duration of
,4–6 h, while images were acquired every 2–3 min at 3100 magnification in the
transmitted and fluorescent channels. Focus was maintained during image
acquisition either by manual adjustment or by contrast-based autofocus algo-
rithms. After each imaging session, fluorescence trajectories of individual cells
were extracted using the WCIF ImageJ cell analysis package. For each fluor-
escence frame, mean values of integrated fluorescence were calculated within
constant circular areas inscribed within the boundaries of all tracked cells. Long-
term fluorescence trajectories were subsequently constructed by manually track-
ing each cell throughout the experiment.
Flow cytometry. Oscillator cells were initially characterized by flow cytometry of
batch cultures to identify inducer conditions that supported oscillations.
Subsequently, time-course flow cytometry was performed on growing cultures
immediately after induction to follow oscillation dynamics. This time-course flow
cytometry followed one of two similar protocols. In the continuous protocol, a
single culture was serially diluted to maintain logarithmic growth. The culture was
induced at the initial time point, and samples were removed for flow cytometry
over the course of the experiment. In the aggregate protocol, an uninduced culture
in logarithmic growth was aliquoted onto different inducer concentrations, and
these subcultures were allowed to grow for varying lengths of time before flow
cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed directly from growing cultures, and
noncellular low-scatter noise was removed by thresholding. Oscillations were
tracked by measuring the mean cellular fluorescence at each time point. The
amplitude of the initial oscillation was usually higher than that of subsequent
oscillations, presumably owing to desynchronization of
the oscillations
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The oscillation period was defined as the time elapsed
between the first and second oscillation peaks. All flow cytometry analysis was
carried out on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan.
