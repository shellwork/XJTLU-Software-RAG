Preface 

As the parliamentary technology assessment organization in the
Netherlands, the Rathenau Institute is always on the lookout for new
scientific developments and technological trends that might have an
important impact on society. In recent years, the institute has devel-
oped a special interest in topics related to nanotechnology and / or
converging technologies.

Synthetic biology is a new emerging scientific field where ICT,
biotechnology and nanotechnology meet and strengthen each other.
The increasing number of people attracted to this field, the growing
number of publications in which scientists publish new results and
are seeking publicity to advertise their views and ideas, as well as the
appearance of review articles in science journals, all indicate that
‘something is happening’. In contrast to the ‘classical approach’ in
molecular biology, synthetic biology appears to be an approach that
enables the design of new biological systems. In a similar vein to
genetic engineering or nanotechnology, synthetic biology raises
important social and ethical questions about the possible impact on
human health and the environment or possible abuses for biological
warfare or terrorist attacks. The introduction of new biological sys-
tems can even force us to redefine ‘life’.

The Rathenau Institute believed that the development of synthetic
biology needed to be examined for its scientific and technological sig-
nificance; and its potential impact on society. When research started
in the spring of 2006, some publications that discussed the role of
risk assessment were already available. However, a broader picture of
the dynamics in this field, and an investigation of the social and polit-
ical agenda were still missing. The study Constructing life: early social
reflections on the emerging field of synthetic biology, written by Huib
de Vriend, is an attempt to fill that gap. It should be seen as a starting
point for further international research and debate, for example on
the role of the government. The study was written in English as a con-
tribution to a coordinated international approach, including the
development of a balanced and effective EU policy. 

Recently synthetic biology has been gaining prominence on the Dutch
political agenda. In August 2006, the Ministry of Education, Culture
and Science asked the Health Council of the Netherlands, the Advisory
Council on Health Research and the Royal Netherlands Academy of
Arts and Sciences to further investigate the technological develop-
ments of synthetic biology. A draft version of this report is being used

within the current debate. The Rathenau Institute will contribute to
this debate by publishing a popular version of this study in Dutch.

1 Introduction

“This is the step we have all been talking about. 
We are moving from reading the genetic code to writing it.”
Craig Venter, founder of Synthetic Genomics Inc., 
Wall Street Journal, June 29, 2005.

The Rathenau Institute is the national technology assessment 
organization in the Netherlands and encourages social debate and 
the development of political opinion on technological and scientific
development. It is therefore interested in the identification of new
technological trends with a potential impact on society. A current
field of interest is the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology,
information technology and cognitive sciences (‘converging technolo-
gies’, or NBIC). This is increasing our understanding of the fundamen-
tal building blocks and mechanisms underlying the characteristics
and properties of artifacts and living organisms (Nordmann, 2004).
The increasing number of publications on synthetic biology in (popu-
lar) scientific journals in 2005 and the first months of 2006 was an
indication of a certain level of ‘maturation’: the publication of new 
scientific results, scientists seeking publicity to advertise their views
and ideas, and the appearance of review articles in science journals
indicate that ‘something is happening’.

At the same time, research into views on synthetic biology is pro-
gressing in Europe. Under the 6th Framework Program, the European
Commission has financed a small number of research projects on syn-
thetic biology (European Commission, 2005a; European Commission,
2005b: New and Emerging Sciences and Technologies (NEST)). The
Swiss Center for Technology Assessment and the Austrian Organiza-
tion for International Dialogue and Conflict Management (IDC, 2006)
have shown an interest in the societal impact of synthetic biology. 

Synthetic biology is a new trend in science and technology and a clear
example of converging technologies. It can potentially trigger social
and political debate. Therefore despite its ‘immature stage’, the
Rathenau Institute has identified synthetic biology as a development
that needs to be examined for its scientific and technological signifi-
cance and its potential impact on society. So far, the vast majority of
articles and papers on synthetic biology have focused on how the
research should be organized and how risk assessment should be
dealt with (such as COGEM, 2006). An analysis from a Technology
Assessment perspective, drawing a broader picture of the dynamics in
this field, and an investigation of the social and political agenda was

still missing. The Rathenau Institute therefore commissioned LIS 
Consult, an independent consultancy on social issues in innovations
in the life sciences, to write an exploratory paper on synthetic biol-
ogy. This paper was written in English so as to contribute to a coordi-
nated international approach, including the development of balanced
and effective EU policy and the 3rd international conference on syn-
thetic biology to be held in Zurich in 2007.

In May 2006, the 2nd International Synthetic Biology Conference was
held in Berkeley, California. This was an excellent opportunity to gain
an impression of the latest developments in synthetic biology
research, scientist’s views on future expectations and relevant social
and political issues, as well as the structure and dynamics of the insti-
tutions and people involved in this area of research. During the first
two days, a wide range of research results and small business initia-
tives were presented. All of the presentations concerned the design
and construction of new biological parts, devices and systems, and the
redesign of existing natural biological systems for useful purposes.
Together the presentations gave an impression of the latest scientific
and technological developments in a field that takes the engineering
approach to biological systems much further than ‘conventional’
genetic modification. It was absolutely fascinating to see how the bio-
molecular basis of growth of sponge skeleton is mimicked in the labo-
ratory, or how cells that contain a predesigned and engineered
artificial cell-to-cell signal system move in patterns. The design of
two-dimensional structures with DNA molecules (DNA origami) and
the idea of bacterial cells that perform basic functions based on a
minimal set of genes (‘the cell as a chassis’) were explained. Some
promising results with potential commercial applications were high-
lighted, such as the production of the anti-malaria drug artemisinin,
and options for biobased energy production. Yet the majority of the
projects focus on fairly basic elements and mechanisms, which
demonstrates the ‘immature’ stage this relatively new area of biologi-
cal engineering is still in. So far genetic modification has, to a certain
extent, operated in the context of, and was limited by, what ‘nature’
has to offer in terms of genetic material, cells and organisms. By 
contrast, synthetic biology applies engineering principles to biology,
which allows for the intended design of fully new biomolecular sys-
tems. Or, as Craig Venter stated in the Wall Street Journal, it is the
step from reading the genetic code to writing it. Synthetic biologists
prefer to draw the parallel with the design of electronic circuits. In
Berkeley scientists were talking about the bacterial cell as a ‘chassis’,
that can be stripped of unnecessary elements and used as a piece of
electronic circuitry board to plug-in biological devices that can per-
form specific, well-defined functions. Based on a detailed understand-
ing of the complex genetic, biochemical and biophysical mechanisms
in cells, efforts are made to develop DNA-based hardware, which they
call ‘switches’, ‘toggles’ and ‘inverters’.

Although it seems too early to make specific claims – and the 
distinction between synthetic biology, genetic modification and
nanobiotechnology is not always very clear – synthetic biology
appears to be an approach that enables the design of new biological
systems and can be used for a wide range of purposes. For the time
being, it is still too early to predict what synthetic biology will deliver
to society, for better or worse. However the scientists involved sin-
cerely believe they can make new things, things that work, things that
will enable us to produce better and cheaper medicine or energy. 
Synthetic biology represents a new way of looking at biology, or even
a new paradigm that seems to contrast with the rapidly developing
more holistic approach to biology, even though both approaches stem
from recent developments in systems biology. Nevertheless, it is the
intention of the engineers to make things that work, to make life as it
could be, no matter how complex life is.

At the same time, however, synthetic biology raises questions about
the possible impact on human health and the environment, and about
possible abuses for biological warfare or terrorist attacks. Questions
that do not differ fundamentally from the questions raised by genetic
engineering or nanotechnology, and which most members of the 
synthetic biology community are well aware of. Fearing regulations
that might limit the further development of synthetic biology, they
propose a system of self-regulation. Yet several NGOs that focus on
the social, economic, cultural and ecological consequences of new
technologies consider this to be unacceptable.

Additionally, synthetic biology forces us to redefine ‘life’. Is life in
fact a cascade of biochemical events, regulated by the heritable code
that is in (and around) the DNA and enabled by biological machinery?
Is the cell a bag of biological components that can be redesigned in a
rational sense? Or is life a holistic entity that has metaphysical
dimensions, rendering it more than a piece of rational machinery?

This study considers whether developments in synthetic biology
require specific attention from a Technology Assessment perspective,
and which scientific, social and political aspects should be further
examined and discussed. This key question is further examined in a
number of subsidiary questions or issues that are dealt with in the
following four chapters.

To start with, a clear definition of synthetic biology was needed: how
does it differ from other existing technologies and what are its unique
characteristics? This was done by exploring definitions and examples
mentioned in the literature and by attending the Berkeley Conference
in May 2006. The outcomes of this are presented in Chapter 2. Special
attention was paid to the position of synthetic biology within the con-
tinuum of developments in biology and engineering (such as genetic
engineering, nano(bio)technology and information and communica-
tion technologies) as well as its relationship with several disciplines
in science and technology. Finally, the ‘newness’ of the approach of
synthetic biology is explored, including the question as to whether
this approach will lead to fundamental changes in how biology and
life are viewed, that is a paradigm shift.

The description of applications and products presented in Chapter 3
provides a window on current developments in synthetic biology. 
An analysis of future expectations, including an estimate of their
probability, gives an impression of what the assumed capabilities 
of the technology are.

Like any other technology, synthetic biology develops in a social con-
text, where decisions are taken about research programs, funding,
legislation and acceptance by end users. Chapter 4 therefore presents
a brief analysis of the driving forces, the structure and dynamics of
the synthetic biology community – scientists, institutions, companies,
authorities, and NGOs.

Chapter 5 lists the social, ethical, and legal issues related to synthetic
biology that may trigger social and political debate and which the syn-
thetic biology community will have to deal with.

Finally Chapter 6 states the main conclusions, and emphasizes the
urgent need for societal and political reflection on specific issues.
Thirty years of experience with technological, social and legal 
developments in genetic engineering is used to formulate suggestions
for the next steps, which could be translated into future European
activities.

2 The characteristics of
synthetic biology

Like most other technologies, synthetic biology is not an isolated 
scientific and engineering discipline. It is rooted in experience and
knowledge of molecular biology: understanding the interactions
between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship
of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis and the regulation of these inter-
actions. Synthetic biology could not exist without the DNA sequence
of an increasing number of organisms being available, the possibility
to identify genes and their functions, and an understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of cell behavior (genomics and systems biol-
ogy). Synthetic biology codevelops with information technologies,
robotics, and nanotechnology. Moreover, new technologies in this
field will be applied in combination with other technologies, in the
context of the convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, infor-
mation technologies, and cognitive science. That makes it difficult to
draw clear lines between synthetic biology and ‘classical’ genetic engi-
neering, or nanotechnology. Accordingly this chapter not only deals
with current definitions, but also uses characterizations from the 
scientific community and several institutions. The characterization
presented will highlight two approaches in synthetic biology: decon-
struction and construction of life. The question how new is synthetic
biology will be explored by relating the development to similar fields
of science and technology: genetic modification, nanotechnology 
and systems biology. As in synthetic biology newness is more or less
equivalent to ‘artificialness’, the development will be ranked in 
terms of ‘levels of artificialness’. Finally, whether the approach in
synthetic biology implicates a paradigm shift – whether it leads to
fundamental changes in views on biology and life, and might there-
fore have an impact on the scientific approach of living entities – will
be explored.

Today numerous researchers and engineers want to design and build
biological systems, and call this work ‘synthetic biology’ (Brent,
2004). They distinguish their work from an older biological engineer-
ing canon, which encompasses fermentation and process engineering
as well as biomedical engineering (prosthetic limbs, laser catheters
guided through arteries and implants). They also distinguish it from a
second, newer recombinant DNA canon, which encompasses engi-

neered organisms that produce proteins or simple chemicals, plants
engineered to produce pesticides and phage vectors designed with
attributes relevant to gene therapy. Instead, the synthetic biologists
have defined their goal as the design and construction of systems that
exhibit complex dynamical behavior, the ability to exist in a number
of states or the ability to execute small numbers of programmed steps
(for example, in complex chemical synthesis).
Several definitions of synthetic biology can be found in the literature,
of which the following three definitions draw a more or less complete
picture:

T h e  B e r k e l e y  d e f i n i t i o n

In 2003 the Physical Biosciences Division at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (LBNL or the Berkeley Lab) established a Synthetic
Biology Department with the claim that this was the world’s first
research facility in synthetic biology (LBNL, 2006). Researchers from
the Synthetic Biology Department and individuals from research labo-
ratories at other institutions in the USA, among which the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, have also
set up a synthetic biology community (http://syntheticbiology.org).
This community defines ‘synthetic biology’ as:

1. the design and construction of biological parts, devices and 

systems, and;

2. the redesign of existing, natural biological systems for useful 

purposes.

Examples used by the LBNL are:
• Production of the anti-malarial drug precursor artemisinic acid by

the bacterium E. coli with genes from three separate organisms (Dae
Kyun, 2006);

• Production of hydrogen by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis with

genes for cellulose-converting enzymes;

• Genetically engineered microorganisms to remediate environmen-

tal contaminants, like heavy metals, actinides and nerve agents.

A Synthetic Society Working Group (SSWG) has been set up within this
community to address societal issues, with a primary interest in con-
sidering the impact of new, engineered biological systems that are
encoded via standard, that is naturally originated, four-base DNA,
namely A(denosine), T(hymine), C(ytosine) and G(uanine). This defini-
tion leaves out certain aspects of synthetic biology research, for
example understanding the origins of life by recreating a cell from
raw chemicals in the lab. There are two pragmatic reasons for this.
First of all, the SSWG believes that the direct engineering of living sys-
tems via standard DNA will have the widest societal impact over the
near term. Secondly SSWG feels it is probably already trying to
achieve too much.

According to the Committee on Genetic Modification (COGEM), the
biosafety expert body to the Dutch Ministry of the Environment, the
term synthetic biology was already used in 1980 for bacteria geneti-
cally altered through recombinant DNA technology (COGEM, 2006).
But now synthetic biology constitutes a specialized field within
genetic modification. In the view of COGEM,

synthetic biology focuses on the design and synthesis of artificial
genes and complete biological systems, and on changing existing
organisms, aimed at acquiring useful functions. 

Apart from the production of the anti-malarial drug precursor
artemisinic acid by the bacterium E. coli with genes from three sepa-
rate organisms, COGEM uses the following examples:
• Bacterial photography system based on E. coli with an inserted

genetic network (Levskaya, 2005) and; 

• Minimal genome bacteria or minimal cells for degradation of toxic

compounds or production of energy.

Interestingly, in contrast to the SSWG, COGEM does not exclude
attempts to create and use an alternative genetic alphabet based on
unnatural DNA bases from its definition of synthetic biology. 

A n  a l t e r n a t i v e  g e n e t i c  a l p h a b e t

Since 1990 attempts have been made to develop an alternative
genetic alphabet to enable the production of peptides and proteins
that do not occur naturally. Such peptides and proteins could lead
to novel therapeutics.

One way of creating an alternative genetic alphabet is to extend
the number of DNA bases by creating unnatural DNA bases, either
through changing the sequence and combination of linkages of
hydrogen bonds on the DNA bases, or through bases which form
base pairs via hydrophobic interactions instead of hydrogen bonds
(Szatmary, 2003; Wu, 2000). An alternative is to modify transfer
(t)RNA to function as a carrier of an unnatural amino acid,
enabling translation of an alternative genetic alphabet into an
unnatural peptide (Bain, 1992). Moreover in 2004, researchers
created a mutant polymerase for the replication of an unnatural
synthetic DNA sequence with a codon of six instead of four bases
(Sismour, 2004; Sismour, 2005). Now it is even possible to use
unnatural amino acids for peptide synthesis without changing the
number of base pairs. A modified tRNA is used that is able to read
codons of four instead of three bases (Anderson, 2004).

A review published under the auspices of the European Commission
Directorate-General Research in October 2005 noted that there are
many different practical approaches to synthetic biology that
emanate from different disciplines, all of which can claim to represent
synthetic biology research and engineering (Synbiology, 2005). It was
argued that any definition should reflect how synthetic biology dif-
fers from classical genetic engineering, while it should also be distin-
guished from the creation of total artificial proto-living particles
(Rasmussen, 2004; Deamer, 2005). Eventually, the report puts more
emphasis on the engineering component and suggested that:

synthetic biology is the engineering of biological components and
systems that do not exist in nature and the re-engineering of existing
biological elements; it is determined on the intentional design of arti-
ficial biological systems, rather than on the understanding of nat-
ural biology.

Projects granted by DG Research illustrate how the European Commis-
sion defines synthetic biology (European Commission, 2005b):
• A cell-based system to produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate

(DHAP)-derived monosaccharides for pharmaceutical applications
based on the optimization of carbohydrate metabolism in E. coli
(EuroBioSyn);

• Rearrangement of genes that code for antibody specificity, aimed at

the creation of a ‘library’ of around one million hybridoma cells,
each expressing a different antibody (HybLib);

• Synthetic cell nuclei analogues, capable of self-assembly in mix-
tures of DNA, macromolecules (or nanoparticles), and lipids for
producing complex biomolecules (Neonuclei);

• Rationally designed gene networks (‘artificial circuits’) with the

ability to sense particular conditions or signals within a cell, and to
respond accordingly, in this case to detect and possibly correct
aberrant cellular functions in cancer cells, which could be applied
in gene therapy and diagnostics (Netsensor).

Synthetic biology can be viewed as the meeting point of two cultures
in molecular biology (de Lorenzo, 2006): ‘deconstructing life’ and
‘constructing life’.

D e c o n s t r u c t i n g  l i f e  ( t o p - d o w n )

The first culture, represented by those in ‘deconstructing life’, dis-

sects biological systems in the search for simplified and minimal
forms that will help to understand the adaptation and evolution of
natural processes. By analogy, this culture could be compared with
the top-down approach in nanotechnology. In top-down nanotechnol-
ogy, the starting point is a larger block of material from which the
desired nanostructure is carved out using physical methods. Top-
down nanotechnology is a natural extension of current methods of
microelectronics, in which structures of very limited dimensions are
created by depositing thin layers of material and etching away the
unwanted parts of each layer (Azonano, 2006).
Similarly, ‘deconstructing life’ is an extension of current methods in
genetic modification. The ‘deconstructing life’ approach includes
experiments to obtain information on isolated parts of biological sys-
tems, the simulation of these systems and then the prediction of asso-
ciated properties followed by further experimental verification.
Examples include work on metabolic pathways, like glycolysis, and
the simulation of cell systems using stochastic approaches. Further,
simplified systems, based on phospholipids or polymers, are used to
explore possible prebiotic systems. Yet research into minimal life
forms and minimal genomes (Csaba, 2006; Galperin, 2006), and the
development of computer viruses to study properties of biological
evolution can also be included in this approach. In short, the ‘decon-
structing life’ approach focuses on the definition of material or virtual
systems that contribute to understanding the properties of complex
biological problems.

While most microbes have hundreds or thousands of genes, some
use only a fraction of these at any one time, depending on their
surroundings. A minimal genome contains the smallest set of
genes an organism needs to live in a particular environment. It can
be compared to the design of software that performs a specific
task in the least possible steps. 
The first attempt to create a minimal genome organism focused on
Mycoplasma genitalium, with 517 genes the smallest gene comple-
ment of any independently replicating cell so far identified. Global
transposon mutagenesis was used to identify non-essential genes
in an effort to learn whether the naturally-occurring gene comple-
ment is a true minimal genome under laboratory growth condi-
tions. The analysis of the research results published in 1999,
carried out by TIGR and Craig Venter from Celera Genomics, sug-
gests that 265 to 350 of the 480 protein-coding genes of M. geni-
talium are essential under laboratory growth conditions. This
includes about 100 genes of unknown function (Hutchinson, 1999).
The J. Craig Venter Institute is still continuing its search for a min-
imal genome Mycoplasma genitalium (Glass, 2006).

The bacterium Bacillus subtilis has about 4100 genes but needs
just 271 genes to live in an experimental environment (Kobayashi,
2003).
Recently, European researchers published the results of an
approach involving genome modeling which, given the organism’s
evolutionary history and knowledge of its surrounding environ-
ment, allows them to predict which genes a bacterium’s genome
should contain (Csaba, 2006). The results suggest systematic
underestimation of the number of genes needed to create a mini-
mal genome organism. Previous attempts to work out the minimal
genome have relied on deleting individual genes in order to infer
which genes are essential for maintaining life. The knock-out
approach misses the fact that there are alternative genetic routes,
or pathways, to the production of the same cellular product. If one
gene is knocked out, the genome can compensate by using an
alternative gene. Yet if the knock-out experiment is repeated by
deleting the alternative, the genome can revert to the original
gene instead. From the knock-out approach it could be inferred
that both genes are expendable from the genome because there
appears to be no deleterious effect in either experiment. Yet
because there are alternative pathways to the same product,
removing either of the genes makes the other essential for sur-
vival; each gene deletion reduces the available space for further
reduction of the genome. Including these alternative pathways in
the minimal genome almost doubles its size.

The second culture is the ‘constructing life’ approach that aims at
building systems inspired by general biological principles using bio-
logical or chemical components to reproduce the behavior of living
systems. In this approach biological phenomena are often addressed
with concepts from electrical engineering. The underlying notion is to
combine autonomous, modular, robust and reusable input and output
components in much the same way as electronic circuits. While input
components sense a given environment – like interfacing with biologi-
cal signals, internal components, processing of biological input infor-
mation inside synthetic systems to minimize side effects – output
components transmit the signal(s) processed by the synthetic setup
back to the biological systems. Engineers believe it will be possible to
design biological components and complex biological systems in a
similar fashion to the design of chips, transistors and electronic cir-
cuits. Each part will need a standard interface and well-defined func-
tion, so that someone at a workstation can assemble working systems
at the abstract level described in the catalogue and pass on the design
to another group of biochemists for synthesis in a biological manufac-
turing system.

In an interview with EE Times, Tom Knight of MIT’s Computer 
Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory explains how engineered
segments of DNA that code for metabolic functions can transform
themselves into functional components of bacteria. 
The DNA codes are in a catalogue of so-called ‘BioBricks’ (Brown,
2004). BioBricks is a registry of Standard Biological Parts, which
includes lists of formatted components, such as protein coding
sequences, ribosome binding sites and cell strains. As they comply
with international standards, these components can easily be distrib-
uted and shared (http://parts.mit.edu/registry/index.php/
Main_Page). The subsequent step involves the combination of these
components into well-specified working devices, which can then be
applied in biological systems. Associated research seeks to develop
containers for these devices, ranging from simple lipid vesicles to min-
imal genomes.

The Registry of Standard Biological Parts (BioBricks)

By analogy, this culture could be compared with bottom-up approaches in
nanotechnology, approaches that start with small components – nearly
always individual molecules – which are assembled to make the desired
structure (Azonano, 2006). In this approach, the term “self assembly” is
often used. The self-assembling properties of biological systems, such as
DNA molecules, can be used to control the organization of species such
as carbon nanotubes, which may ultimately lead to the ability to ‘grow’
parts of an integrated circuit, rather than having to rely upon expensive
top-down techniques.

19

In the summer of 2005, over 150 students and lecturers from 13 uni-
versities across the world made, shared, and used BioBricks as part of
the International Genetically-Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition.
Projects ranged from the design and in vivo implementation of a gene
circuit that can count to 2, to engineering a biological wire capable of
propagating a chemical signal down its length (iGEM, 2005).

Building systems with parts and devices (Endy, 2006)

There is a difference between the two cultures. The ‘deconstruction’
community seeks to understand biological systems and their evolu-
tion, whereas the ‘construction’ community searches for general
design principles regardless of their relationship to actual biological
systems. However both hope that the exploration and construction of
these biological systems will expand scientific understanding of the
organizational principles behind living molecular systems. Further
the two approaches are linked by their dependence on very similar
theoretical, experimental and computational techniques. Finally, both
approaches address the key issue of how to synthesize genetic net-
works with well-defined functions under clear controllable replica-
tion, transcription and translation conditions, which requires skills in
analyzing, predicting and designing genome elements.

Synthetic biology involves a wide range of scientific disciplines and
technologies, systems biology and computational simulation and
analysis being the major ones.

Synthetic biology uses the same type of knowledge as most of the
ongoing developments in biology and engineering, such as genetic
engineering and nanobiotechnology. In applications it will often be
combined knowledge from other technologies, for instance informa-
tion and communication technologies. Therefore the boundaries with
other scientific disciplines and technologies are transient. Attempts
to draw a clear line as to where synthetic biology starts and other
technologies end could easily lead to endless discussions, and it
seems more fruitful to consider synthetic biology in the context of
several scientific and technological disciplines. 

S c i e n t i f i c  d i s c i p l i n e s  a n d  t e c h n o l o g i e s  i n v o l v e d

While naturally-occurring genetic networks have been fine-tuned
through evolution, synthetic genetic networks can be optimized using
computational simulation (Bell, 2006) and computer software, like
BioSPICE (http://biospice.lbl.gov; McDaniels, 2005) and BioJADE
(Goler, 2004). Another key issue is the modulation of functional speci-
ficity. For both newly-designed components and those extracted from
biological systems, a clear understanding is needed of how they adapt
to specific working conditions and how the interactions that deter-
mine the properties of stability and adaptation of molecular systems
could be engineered. Examples include the design of transcription
factors, which are able to trigger the activation of specific genes,
whether these are designed rationally (Bayer, 2005; Isaacs, 2004) or
obtained by directed evolution (Yokobayashi, 2002). Computational
analysis of protein families and of protein-DNA structures (genomics,
proteomics) is clearly essential for the development of these compo-
nents. 

Synthetic biology also involves other scientific disciplines like nan-
otechnology, organic chemistry, immunology, biokinesis, and tissue
engineering.

The transient nature of the boundary between ‘classical’ genetic engi-
neering, nanobiotechnology and synthetic biology is not apparent
from the definitions provided in Chapter 2.1. Some of the examples
mentioned in the preceding section contain clear elements, or could
even be classified as (sophisticated) applications of genetic modifica-
tion and nanobiotechnology. 

Although genetic modification is sometimes presented as a technol-
ogy that does not differ essentially from what has happened during
many thousands of years in natural evolution, as a way to overcome
hybridization barriers, the technology is usually considered a new,
and artificial step in breeding organisms with new traits. In the past
thirty years since the first genetically modified microorganism was
created, recombinant DNA technologies have developed from rather
basic trial-and-error methods to introduce naturally-occurring genes
into organisms to sophisticated, and well-targeted methods to intro-
duce desired new traits. Technologies such as protein engineering
and DNA shuffling have been developed that enable scientists to alter
the structure and functionality of proteins (enzymes) expressed in
modified microorganisms and plants (Vlaggraduateschool, 2006;
Castle, 2004). These technologies involve the creation of mutants –
both well-specified and at random – starting from naturally existing
organisms.

Moreover, the role of systems biology in genetic modification is
increasing. In contrast to much of molecular biology, systems biology
does not seek to break down a system into all of its constituent parts
and study each process in turn. Instead it seeks to integrate different
levels of information to understand how biological systems function,
by studying the relationships and interactions between various parts
of a biological system (e.g., gene and protein networks involved in cell
signaling, metabolic pathways, organelles, cells, physiological sys-
tems, organisms, etc.). Increased understanding of the role and func-
tions of DNA in a complex environment (cell, organism) will
contribute to more predictable effects of genetic modification.

In this context it is worthwhile recalling the definition of biotechnol-
ogy in the Convention on Biological Diversity of 1992: any technologi-
cal application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or
derivatives thereof, to make or modify products and processes for spe-
cific use (CBD, 1992). This definition was adopted to ensure that virtu-
ally all applications of biotechnology that might impact biological
diversity would be covered by the Convention. While it can be argued
that synthetic biology falls within the Convention’s definition of
biotechnology, the US synthetic biology community, European policy

makers and COGEM believe there is a need to distinguish it from
biotechnology. There is however no consensus as to whether the cre-
ation and use of unnatural DNA bases and total artificial proto-living
particles should be viewed as applications of synthetic biology.

DNA molecules have a diameter of 2 nanometers. Thus, in terms of
scale, nanobiotechnology includes any type of engineering at the DNA
level, and synthetic biology could be considered a specific discipline
of nanobiotechnology. Nanobiotechnology may be applied in the
design of nanosensors or nanobots that perform specific functions in
biological systems (such as the human body). It is generally believed
that synthetic biology can provide the tools and understanding
needed to develop nanobiotechnology in a more systematic manner
(Ball, 2005). For MIT’s Tom Knight, engineered organisms represent
the quickest route for a true nanotechnology that could manufacture
materials and systems on a molecular scale. His dictum: “Biology is
the nanotechnology that works.” (Brown, 2004).

It seems helpful to create some structure in the chaos of scientific 
disciplines, technological tools and applications by arranging them in
levels of ‘artificialness’, as has been done in a literature and statistical
review by the European Commission (Synbiology, 2005). The results
are presented in the diagram below, which has eight levels of artifi-
cialness, ranging from completely natural systems to completely 
artificial systems:

1. Systems biology is crucial to synthetic biology. It includes knowl-
edge about the natural basic biological functions of RNA and DNA
sequences in information storage, energy supply, membrane func-
tions, cell structure, cell-to-cell signaling, gene regulation (gene
expression), and metabolic functions in natural systems (the lowest
level in the diagram).
These functions can be influenced by modulating the molecules
using different technical methods, leading to different levels of
synthetic biology towards artificial carbon-based life.

2. Based on this knowledge, the function of molecules (proteins,

enzymes) can be optimized, specific genes or (micro)RNAs can be
added or suppressed (= genetic engineering) and molecular biology
and bioinformatics developed. As these disciplines and technolo-
gies are based on natural systems, they are still on a relatively low
level of artificialness in the diagram below.

3. At the next level, design principles are introduced, but still at a

rather basic level, aimed at individual components and pathways.
This includes the design of synthetic genes and metabolic path-
ways, the regulation of gene expression (transcription), and modu-
lation of translation and regulation.

4. Synthetic approaches for regulation, translation and replication of

synthetic genes are required to integrate these components and
pathways in synthetic genetic systems, which are put at the fourth
level. Information for self-replication in living systems is intrinsic –
it is the central part.

5. The integration of genes, pathways, and mechanisms for regula-
tion, translation and replication in complex biogenetic systems
results in synthetic genomics, as well as synthetic cell structures,
such as the endoskeleton that shapes the cell, and cell regulation
systems that are responsible for interactions in and between cells.

6. The preceding steps should result in synthetic or artificial (not

occurring in nature) biomolecules and pathways.

7/8. The highest level of integration is the organism, which can be

partly natural, partly synthetic, or completely synthetic.

Typology of biological research and technologies as natural or 
artificial systems: From Molecular Biology to Modular Biology

Molecular biology approaches and genetic modification, which are
still based on natural systems and synthesis of natural systems, are at
levels 1 and 2.
Levels 3 to 5 represent different steps in the rational and evolutionary
design of genes and their expression in the modulation of genes,

24

genomes, pathways, regulation systems and biomolecules. At these
levels, combinations of synthetic and natural elements can be found.
The top of the diagram represents the synthesis of artificial and
partly artificial systems, such as artificial genes with an artificial
function in combination with artificial regulation.

As the diagram in Chapter 2.3 shows, synthetic biology leads to a shift
in focus from the understanding of naturally-occurring biological
functions to using a minimalist approach to define and design them.
In other words, a shift from analytic to synthetic, from ‘molecular
biology’ to ‘modular biology’ (Synbiology, 2005). This implies funda-
mental changes in the type of questions that are supposed to be asked
in biology, how these are structured and the answers probed for. 

V i e w s  o f  s y n t h e t i c  b i o l o g i s t s

This shift in focus is best illustrated by the views of scientists who
consider themselves synthetic biologists, who are truly convinced
they are involved in a totally new approach to biological systems.
“Biology will never be the same”, states Tom Knight in a commentary
in Molecular Systems Biology, September 2005 (Knight, 2005). Just
like electrical engineering grew from physics to become a separate
discipline in the early part of the twentieth century, we are now wit-
nessing the growth of a new engineering discipline: one oriented to
the intentional design, modeling, construction, debugging, and test-
ing of artificial living systems, Knight argues. According to Drew
Endy, biology is going through a fundamental transition from preex-
isting, natural, and evolving systems, to synthetic, engineered, and
disposable systems (Endy, 2005). In the second year of her electrical
engineering degree, while testing antilock car brakes, Samantha
Sutton felt there was something missing: “I felt the average engineer
in my division wasn’t really hacking and constructing as I wanted to.
They were fine-tuning, refining. I just didn’t find it terribly exciting.”
Sutton switched to biology after graduating, and is now building “cir-
cuits” from proteins rather than wires at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology. For Sutton and others involved in synthetic biology, a
bacterial cell is regarded as a “chassis”. The complexity of the cell can
be stripped down and used as a circuit board and power supply. “Let’s
get rid of all the dangling wires that might short out our circuits”,
says George Church, referring to several attempts to create organisms
containing the minimal amount of genetic information needed to per-
form basic functions (Aldhous, 2006). The next step is to plug in
‘basic circuit elements’ that make the cell predesigned, and precisely

define functions. A range of such ‘basic circuit elements’ is being
developed, such as ‘toggle switches’, ‘ring oscillators’ and ‘inverters’.
Indeed, Tom Knight views the emerging field through the lens of elec-
trical engineering and circuit design. “Why are engineers good at
doing this, why are we the right people?” he asks. “I would argue that
we have a set of tools and an intellectual approach suited to this task.”
(Brown, 2004). With such statements, synthetic biologists make a
point of distinguishing themselves from ‘genetic engineers’. “Genetic
engineering doesn’t look or feel like any form of engineering”, Drew
Endy says. He argues that the biotech industry rarely attempts any-
thing much more sophisticated than getting E. coli to make large
quantities of a single protein from another organism. Even then, it
often takes extensive research to discover why a sequence borrowed
in this way fails to work well out of its usual context. 

Although it could be argued that synthetic biology is nothing more
than a logical extension of the reductionist approach that dominated
biology during the second half of the twentieth century, the use of
engineering language, and the practical approach of creating stan-
dardized cells and components like in electrical circuitry suggests a
paradigm shift. Biology is no longer considered ‘nature at work’, but
becomes an engineering discipline. True engineers, notes Endy, build
much more sophisticated systems, which slot together according to a
predetermined design and work reliably. When considered as a piece
of machinery, nature is imperfect and should and can be revised and
improved.

Meanwhile, new discoveries in genetics, epigenetics, evolutionary
biology, genomics and other areas of ‘–omics’ have resulted in an
increasing number of scientific publications, challenging the reduc-
tionist approach that points towards DNA as being the stuff that gen-
erally determines an organism’s characteristics. Nowadays, it is
generally accepted that cell functions are not simply defined and 
controlled by genes. Gene expression, protein production, and inter-
cellular interactions are instead controlled by a complex of (partly yet
unknown) factors, including histon codes, various RNAs, as well as
several environmental factors. Some scientists question the model of
the double helix structure of DNA. A review of research on DNA’s 
secondary structure in Current Science in 2003 shows that the double
helix model, developed by Watson & Crick in 1953, is not the only
type of secondary structure of DNA in living organisms (Delmonte,
2003). Recent research has demonstrated that protein-coding
sequences do not always have a clear beginning or end, and that RNA
is a key part of the information package. This makes the whole con-
cept of the ‘gene’ fuzzy (Pearson, 2006).

“In biology details matter, and we do not understand the details”, says
Frances Arnold, a specialist in the engineering of cell-to-cell commu-
nication from the California University of Technology. She draws the
parallel of writing a book: “Literature is not written by taking frag-
ments from Internet and pasting them together. Now we have that
funky code that looks more like the Google function of Moby Dick
than Moby Dick” (Arnold, 2006a: webcast).

According to Carl Woese (expert in the field of microbial taxonomy,
discoverer of the large-scale structure of the tree of life, with all living
creatures descended from three primordial branches) the molecular
vision had been realized by the end of the twentieth century, and is
not capable of telling us how complex biological systems really work.
He calls for a new, deeper, more invigorating representation of real-
ity. “Knowing the parts of isolated entities is not enough… Machines
are not made of parts that continually turn over, renew. The organism
is… While machinery is a mere collection of parts, some sort of “sense
of the whole” inheres in the organism.” (Woese, 2004). Organisms con-
tain different kinds of mechanisms to repair damage, or to overcome
the consequences of damage. Woese chooses the metaphor of stream-
ing water to explain how organisms function: “Imagine a child playing
in a woodland stream, poking a stick into an eddy in the flowing cur-
rent, thereby disrupting it. But the eddy quickly reforms, and the 
fascinating game goes on. Organisms are resilient patterns in turbu-
lent flow patterns in an energy flow”. To understand living organisms
in any deep sense, we must come to see them not materialistically, as
machines, but as (stable) complex, dynamic organizations, Woese 
concludes.

Both the reductionist approach in synthetic biology and the tendency
to a more holistic approach of Woese and many other biologists stem
from results in systems biology research. Once again it is Tom Knight
who characterizes the difference between the two approaches in
terms of the difference between a biologist and an engineer: “A biolo-
gist goes into the lab, studies a system and finds that it is far more
complex than anyone suspected. He’s delighted, he can spend a lot of
time exploring that complexity and writing papers about it. An engi-
neer goes into the lab and makes the same finding. His response is:
‘How can I get rid of this?’” (Brown, 2004).

However, it would be a mistake to conclude that the engineers in 
synthetic biology do not acknowledge the complexity of biological
systems; they are just convinced they can simplify it and make it 
work by design.

3 Current developments
in synthetic biology:
Applications, products
and expectations 

Theoretically, the possibilities of synthetic or artificial biological
structures and systems seem endless. One could imagine the future
design of artificial vesicles, containing a completely artificial genome
designed at will, and completely artificial cellular machinery, which
takes care of the translation of the genetic code into proteins and
replication, that could actively communicate with other cells. For the
social and political debate it is important to know whether this is a
valid picture of the future of synthetic biology or merely science fic-
tion. How real are the promises made, and how real are the threats?
What can be expected from synthetic biology in the next five to ten
years? This chapter gives an impression with the description of seven
categories of applications, ranging from new therapeutics and drugs
to biosensors and energy production. It demonstrates that there is
more than the examples that recently drew a lot of media attention,
such as photographic pictures produced with light-sensitive bacteria,
and bacteria producing an anti-malarial drug. One example is the 
synthetic biology of stem cells. Combined with an analysis of future
expectations, including an estimate of their probability, this gives 
an impression of what the assumed capabilities of the technology 
are.

So far, all applications of synthetic biology are in the Research &
Development (R&D) phase. Specific press attention was attracted by
gimmicks such as the construction of origami-like patterns with DNA,
microbes blinking in coordinated rhythm, prototypes of synthesized
biomolecular motility and light-sensitive bacteria that can capture a
photographic image. The application of synthetic biology to design
biosensors that can differentiate between espresso, coffee and decaf
demonstrates the potential to construct ultrasensitive biosensors.
Bacteria can be designed for use as remotely-controlled therapeutic
agents in tumors or for the production of new drugs. Stem cells can be

Pathogenic bacteria and viruses are experts at identifying specific cell
types and organs, can evade immune responses and can manipulate
individual cells. They can therefore be engineered for usage as live
therapeutic agents. For example, it has been demonstrated that wild
type Salmonella typhimurium localizes to tumors after intravenous
injection and can impart a therapeutic effect. To improve efficacy,
strains of the bacteria S. typhimurium have been engineered to
require adenosine for growth, convert a pro-drug into an active form
and ameliorate septic shock. In addition, the bacteria can be remotely
controlled after being administered to a patient by using the antibi-
otics tetracycline and mitomycin C to elicit a response in engineered
bacteria thriving in a tumor (Voigt, 2005). Programming bacteria to
have therapeutic functions will require a toolbox of cellular sensors
that respond to micro-environments in the body, genetic circuits to
integrate this information and the ability to engineer the interaction
between a bacterium and a mammalian cell. 

Viruses can also have therapeutic properties. For example, the harm-
less human virus AAV2 kills a broad range of cancer cell lines but does
not affect primary cells. Yet the wild type virus has drawbacks, like
preexisting immunity, delivery efficiency, distribution in the body,
production and cell-type targeting. Directed evolution has therefore
been used to generate mutants that overcome some of these limita-
tions (Koerber, 2006). Therapeutic viruses can also be engineered to
interfere with an infection of harmful viruses. For instance, a
lentivirus has been engineered that interacts with HIV-infected cells
to reduce the HIV viral setpoint in blood, thereby preventing the
transgression of the disease to AIDS.

Tools from synthetic biology already have an impact on metabolic
engineering, in which the goal is to create a microorganism or organ-
ism that produces a maximum yield of a desired chemical. For exam-
ple, by combining metabolic pathways from bacteria, yeast and the
plant Artemisia annua, an Escherichia coli has been created that syn-
thesizes large quantities of the precursor of the anti-malarial drug
artemisin. The production of the precursor was maximized by codon
optimization of the plant enzyme amorphadiene cyclase using DNA
synthesis (142-fold improvement), incorporation of a heterologous
yeast mevalonate pathway (30-fold), and optimization of the intra-
genic messenger RNA structures of the synthetic mevalonate operon
(7-fold) (Ro, 2006; Pfleger, 2006). A similar engineering approach

could be used to optimize microbial production of other therapeutic
terpenes, such as taxol, which is used for cancer treatment, and pros-
tratin, which is used in clinical trials for HIV treatment (Voigt, 2005).
Although more complicated, specific targeting of protein expression
could allow for efficient production of drug components in plants too.
Specific targeting has been applied in plants for elevated production
of a synthetic analogue of spider dragline silk protein (DP1B) in 
Arabidopsis. Researchers used a synthetic DP1B gene for producing
silk-like protein in genetically-modified plants at a level of less than
1.5 percent of total soluble protein in the plant cells. DP1B productiv-
ity in seeds was increased by 5.4 to 7.8 fold by using endoplasmic
reticulum and vacuole targeting in seeds and apoplast, and endoplas-
mic targeting in leafs (Yang, 2005).

Stem cells are able to proliferate and differentiate into many different
cell types and are a natural repair mechanism. Understanding the
mechanisms of this process will enable the control and programming
of stem cells and their use as a therapy to replace cells destroyed by
disease or to grow new tissues.

Stem cells can be programmed in several ways. First, their behavior
can be tuned by controlling the properties of a well-characterized
external micro-environment. For example, an external matrix, consist-
ing of gel polymers modified to display a small domain of the large
protein laminen, can elicit stem cells to proliferate and differentiate
into neural stem cells. Second, synthetic circuits can be introduced
that control the activity of central signaling proteins. For example, the
sonic hedgehog protein controls whether neural stem cells undergo
proliferation or differentiation (Lai, 2004). And the enzyme Rho
GTPase can be engineered to control the differentiation of stem cells
into fat or bone.

RNA has the capability to bind small molecules and regulate gene
expression, making it an ideal substrate for designing biosensors that
mechanically link the input with an output response. For example, a
cell-based biosensor has been built by linking a RNA aptamer that
binds a small molecule ligand with a piece of RNA that inhibits or acti-
vates translation, which could differentiate between espresso, coffee
and decaf (Bayer, 2005). Synthetic sensors can also be constructed by
fusing an extracellular input domain of a protein to an intracellular
signal transducer domain. This strategy was used to design an
Escherichia coli that can record a pattern of light that is shown on a
bacterial lawn, that is ‘bacterial photography’ (Voigt, 2005).

Programming cells will require the integration of signals from multi-
ple (bio)sensors. Receiving information from multiple sources pro-
vides greater specificity when linking gene expression to an
environmental niche. A so-called AND gate, in which the output is
only activated when all inputs are on, is a particularly useful circuit.
Several AND gates have been developed, using DNA, RNA and protein
components that function in vitro, within bacteria and in eukaryotic
cells. One example is an AND gate that identifies four ‘symptoms’ 
signals (abnormal up- or down-regulation of specific mRNA levels) 
and releases a nucleotide drug in response. But OR and antagonistic
logical gates have also been created.

Further, obtaining programmable multicellular organization will
require the use of genetic circuits that control cell-to-cell communica-
tion. A genetic circuit has for instance been created that regulates
bacterial population density using a sensor linked to the expression
of a toxic protein. Such genetic circuits could be used to program 
temporal-spatial patterns into cells, which has applications in the
design of biofilms and the growth of synthetic tissue (Ball, 2004).

The ability to design the sequence of a biomolecule to fold into a
target structure has been increasing rapidly. For example, through
using a computational algorithm that generates pairs of proteins that
bind to each other, protein circuits have been created and signal path-
ways have been rewired. Moreover, algorithms have been developed
for the design of nucleotide sequences to program synthetic mechani-
cal functions into RNA and DNA. This has been used to create a system
of DNA fragments that are able to self-assemble into a motor analo-
gous to kinesin and take the first steps along a piece of DNA. This
opens up the possibility of programming mechanical functions into
cells using nucleotide sequences. A possible application is the design
of a new organism to produce hydrogen from renewable cellulose
resources with high efficiency (controlled growth, elimination of side
reactions that might reduce efficiency). Another possible application
is the alternate design of promoters (Voigt, 2005).

According to Frances Arnold (2006b), directed evolution is a rapid
method for engineering a biological system. In natural evolution the
complexity of living things are attributed to a ‘Darwinian’ algorithm of
mutation and natural selection. The products of such an algorithm are
apparent at all levels, from the diversity of life all the way down to
individual protein molecules. Scientists and engineers who wish to

redesign these same molecules are now implementing their own ver-
sions of the algorithm. Directed evolution allows us to explore func-
tions of biological molecules never required in the natural
environment and for which the molecular basis is poorly understood.
This bottom-up design approach contrasts with the more conven-
tional, top-down one in which proteins are tamed ‘rationally’ using
computers and site-directed mutagenesis. It can be used to improve
metabolic pathways, mRNA switches, viruses and genetic circuits.
Several strategies have now become available, to search through large
libraries and to identify functional circuits.

Analyzing expectations in this field is difficult. The hype about syn-
thetic biology needs to be separated from the hard results. It reminds
Ari Patrinos, chief of genome research at the US Department of
Energy, of the very early days of the Human Genome Project. “This is
the frontier” of biology, he notes (Pennisi, 2005). Indeed, cellular sys-
tems are complex, yet not fully understood, and therefore difficult to
mimic. The most overwhelming and certain use of DNA synthesis is,
and will be its direct acceleration of ongoing, constructive experimen-
tal research. Thus, fully synthetic or artificial organisms are still sci-
ence fiction. In terms of the level of artificialness, most examples are
still in the range of level 3 (see Chapter 2.3.), where design principles
are introduced, but still at a rather basic level, aimed at individual
components and pathways. It includes the design of synthetic genes
and metabolic pathways, the regulation of gene expression (transcrip-
tion), and modulation of translation and regulation. Nevertheless, at
this level several ‘modest’ goals are achievable and have already been
demonstrated, and seven fields of application can be distinguished.
Usually, it is difficult to predict the development of a technology
when it is still at an early stage of development. Often, researchers
are overenthusiastic, the need for more research funding is too domi-
nant, journalists are too eager to write a story about ‘revolutionary
technologies’, and promises are overestimated. Many researchers
involved in synthetic biology seem well aware of this, which is why
most of them are careful in making predictions. Several scientists
stress that there are many technological, legal and commercial obsta-
cles that must be overcome before the practical applications of the
technology can be realized. And when such predictions are made, it is
often added that similar predictions were made several years ago.
Nonetheless, the ever-increasing speed of gene analysis and gene 
synthesis will decrease their costs and availability, and this will speed

up the recently started learning curve. Biological technologies will be
applied to develop new, (partly) synthetic biological systems that can
operate in contained environments within the next ten years.

Some predict that the advent of the home molecular or synthetic 
biology laboratory is not far off (Carlson, 2003). The use of mail-order
oligonucleotides to build a functional poliovirus from constituent
molecules in 2002, followed by the recreation of the Spanish flu virus
by US Army scientists in 2005 are generally considered the first suc-
cessful attempts to reconstruct a living entity (Cello, 2002; Tumpey,
2005). In 2006, the synthesis of most viral genomes are within the
range of today’s technologies. At this point, however, the field is more
talk than reality, says Craig Venter. “There’s not a lot of data yet.”
(Pennisi, 2005). Craig Venter confirms that any sequenced viral
genome including select agents can be made today. He thinks that the
construction of ‘designer viruses’, which are considered a potential
threat, is over a decade away. His guess is that the synthesis of

Predictions for application of synthetic biology (Venter, 2006)

prokaryotes (bacteria) will be possible within two years, and synthesis
of single-cell eukaryotes will be possible within ten years. Further-
more, by developing cassettes of 5–10 genes that are then assembled
together with homologous recombination, Venter’s team is trying to
assemble synthetic chromosomes, which can replace the existing
chromosome. Venter expects that in the near future robots will be
able to assemble thousands to millions of chromosomes per day,
which will be a big step forward in synthetic genomics. Meanwhile,
Venter admits that he made the same predictions several years ago
(Venter, 2006: webcast). Others, like COGEM, expect that many tech-

34

nological hurdles still need to be overcome, especially in the case of
total artificial synthetic organisms (COGEM, 2006). Venter admits that
the assembly of synthetic chromosomes is a totally new field, where
the technology is not fully developed. No cell genome has yet been
synthesized and genome replacement has not yet been demonstrated.
Others expect synthesis of bacterial genomes will be possible within
one to two years. Attempts are being made to design a synthetic E. coli
genome and Jeff Boeke, Stanford University, plans to construct a com-
plete synthetic Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. 

As a result of developments in bioinformatics, high-throughput 
analysis systems etcetera, the time required to design, construct and
test a synthetic biological system or organism is declining due to 
several enabling technologies (Voigt, 2005). Large-scale genome
sequencing projects have provided a toolbox of (microbial) genetic
components that can be exchanged between organisms and combined.
In addition, decreasing DNA synthesis costs are rendering the rela-
tively slow process of cloning and classical molecular biology obso-
lete. Nowadays, automated commercial instrumentation handles an
increasing fraction of laboratory tasks that were once solely con-
ducted by doctoral level researchers, thereby reducing labor costs
and increasing productivity. Moreover, apart from information about
writing DNA from scratch, extensive instructions on standard chem-
istry and molecular biology techniques are available on the Internet,
including detailed descriptions of PCR and other important DNA engi-
neering procedures. While at the start of the 1990s the sequencing of
DNA and the creation of genetically modified organisms were the
province of PhD scientists, today they can be created by people with
little formal education, as there are now commercially available kits
that include relatively simple recipes for moving genes between
organisms. And there are efforts, like the BioBricks project, to stan-
dardize genetic parts to improve the predictability of designs and
facilitate the exchange of materials between research groups. These
technologies will drive new R&D and enable practical application of
synthetic biology. Other examples are the class taught at MIT in which
students ranging from undergraduates to post-docs design and test
new genetic circuits, and the International Genetically Engineered
Machine (iGEM) competition; successful designs are included in the
registry of Standard Biological Parts (BioBricks). 

Commercial DNA synthesis capabilities can be used to illustrate the
rapid proliferation of biological technologies. At present, there about
50 commercial DNA synthesis companies worldwide, the majority
being very small (there are about four slightly larger companies: Blue
Heron, Coda Genomics, DNA2.0, Codon Devices and GeneArt based in
Germany) most in the USA and Europe and several in Asia (Morton,
2005). In July 2006, Codon Devices announced the successful synthe-
sis of a sequence of DNA more than 35,000 base pairs long. Codon

hopes to create DNA fragments of more than 100,000 base pairs in
2008 (Herper, 2006). While gene synthesis is now conducted by PhDs,
the processes will be largely automated within a few years. It is
expected that commodity prices will drop by 30 percent to 50 percent
per year. Moreover, the ability to produce bigger genes (containing
more base pairs) is increasing rapidly. Any government or organiza-
tion can now set up a gene synthesis facility for an investment of
about 500,000 US dollars per year and three to six PhDs. It is not
expected that it will become a ‘garage technology’ for lone hackers
with few resources. 

Drew Endy, assistant professor of biological engineering at MIT, is
convinced that the most overwhelming and certain use of DNA synthe-
sis will be its direct acceleration of ongoing, constructive experimen-
tal research. Today, for example, a practising experimental biologist
or biological engineer can easily spend around 50 percent of their
effort manipulating DNA just to produce the genetic material needed
for an experiment; ‘instant’ DNA synthesis would provide a general
twofold increase in research productivity (Endy, 2005).

It should be noted that in a changing environment, life needs to be
able to continually adapt and evolve. Artificial environments, like
those of technical processes of biotransformation or bioproduction
by microorganisms, are much less intricate than nature, thus reducing
the complexity needed in regulatory function (Synbiology, 2005). Cre-
ation of synthetic or artificial organisms with the ability to survive in
natural environments will therefore be far more difficult, and will
require a longer development time than the creation of synthetic or
artificial organisms that can survive in artificial environments. Never-
theless, Venter states that (partly) synthetic organisms designed for
bioremediation will need to survive in a (specific) open environment.

Synthetic biologists have accomplished a great deal in a short time,
which creates an atmosphere of considerable and sincere enthusiasm,
where anything seems possible. At this stage, synthetic biology is at a
similar level of development to genetic modification in the late 1970s.
Although the scientific environment has changed dramatically in the
past 25 years, it is tempting to draw a parallel with the promises and
realities of genetic engineering, and it may be assumed that the pre-
dictions made by the scientists involved in synthetic biology research
overestimate the capabilities and speed of development. First of all,
major technological and organizational obstacles must be overcome
before the practical applications of the technology can be realized.
One problem is that the behavior of bioengineered systems remains
“noisy” and unpredictable. Genetic circuits also tend to mutate rapidly
and become nonfunctional. Drew Endy of MIT believes that synthetic
biology will not achieve its potential until scientists can accurately
predict how a new genetic circuit will behave inside a living cell. He

argues that the engineering of biological systems remains expensive,
unreliable, and ad hoc because scientists do not understand the mole-
cular processes of cells well enough to manipulate them reliably
(Tucker, 2006). Intellectual property rights may limit researchers’
access to methods and technologies, and may hinder disclosure of
materials in scientific publications and the open exchange of knowl-
edge. Existing and eventually new regulations may require extensive
documentation of health and environmental risk analysis and lengthy
legal procedures. And finally, the limited number of end users at the
Berkeley Conference in May 2006 illustrates the uncertainty of busi-
ness prospects. 

Meanwhile, several initiatives have taken to facilitate future R&D in
synthetic biology. The BioBricks initiative has been set up as an effort
to facilitate research in synthetic biology by standardizing synthetic
DNA parts (standardized coding sequences for protein production and
gene regulation) and devices that contain several parts, designed for
specific functions (switches, logic operators, tags, detectors). The
idea is that such well defined and characterized parts and devices can
be combined to construct and test different systems. Drew Endy, one
of the initiators of BioBricks, considers this to be a suitable engineer-
ing solution for avoiding or managing biological complexity and the
apparent spontaneous physical variation of biological system behav-
ior (Endy, 2005). 

Within the next ten years these biological technologies will undoubt-
edly be applied to develop new, (partly) synthetic biological systems
that can operate in contained environments. Although technological,
environmental, and possibly also legal and commercial constraints
may hinder the creation of completely synthetic organisms and appli-
cations in open environments, developed countries have entered a
period in which the understanding of biological systems is resulting
in new biologically based technologies. These in turn lead to new
insights and new technologies, further enhancing the ability to under-
stand and engineer biological systems. In addition, the demand for
more capable technologies is both broad and deep. It seems very
likely that the trend to increasingly sophisticated yet less expensive
instrumentation will continue. Like genetic modification technologies
in the 1980s and 1990s, biological technologies will become increas-
ingly commoditized. Consequently, their wide distribution will fur-
ther accelerate discovery and invention.

4 The synthetic 
biology community 
and its dynamics

Like any other technology, synthetic biology develops in a social 
context, where decisions are taken about research programs, funding,
legislation and acceptance by end users. Therefore, a brief analysis of
the driving forces, the structure and dynamics of the synthetic biol-
ogy community – scientists, institutions, companies, authorities, and
NGOs – is presented. Estimates of journal publications, the number of
scientists involved and research funding are used to characterize the
field of synthetic biology.

Estimates of journal publications, the number of scientists involved
and research funding indicate strong US dominance in the field of
synthetic biology.

that 68 percent of all journal publications in this area have been pro-

vided by organizations in the USA and 24 percent by organizations in
the EU, whereas 3 percent have come from Japan, 3 percent from
Israel and the remaining 2 percent from Australia, China, India,
Switzerland and Canada. Within the USA more than 30 percent of the
US journal publications have been provided by organizations in Cali-
fornia (Stanford, Berkley, Caltech, Scribbs, UCLA) and nearly 20 per-
cent by those based in Massachusetts (MIT, Harvard, Howard Hughes). 

The Synbiology project has also developed a search mechanism that
identifies synthetic biology journal publications, funding sources,
research and engineering activities, scientists and institutions (Synbi-
ology, 2005; see Appendix 2). So far, more than 250 synthetic biolo-
gists have been identified worldwide, 66 percent of them based in the
US and 25 percent based in Europe, operating in seven different
fields. On the one hand, it should be noted that seven of the twenty-
five individuals active in the field ‘Concepts and political strategy’ are
science journalists rather than scientists – freelance or affiliated with
scientific journals, like Nature and Nature Biotechnology, or popular
magazines, like Scientific American, Popular Science and EE Times; 
one individual is a policy maker at the European Commission DG
Research. On the other hand it should be noted that the “brand” syn-
thetic biology was introduced in US, and many Europeans work in
related fields without declaring themselves synthetic biologists.
Therefore, the results include some degree of uncertainty. 

From the funding perspective, the US dominance is even stronger. The
main sources of funding of synthetic biology research and engineer-
ing have been the US National Institutes of Health (18 percent), US
Defense Funds (14 percent), the US National Science Foundation (9
percent), the US Energy Department (6 percent), US Universities and
Institutes (4 percent) and other US organizations and funds (34 per-
cent). In 2004, the University of California at Berkeley, the Institute
for OneWorld Health, Albany, and California-based upstart Amyris
Biotechnologies received a $ 42.5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation to refine a process for producing the antimalarial
drug artemisinin in the lab with genetically engineered microbes
(Kanellos, 2004). More recently, in 2006, the National Science Founda-
tion decided to fund a Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center
(SynBERC) with a grant of $ 17 million dollar. SynBERC involves
researchers from MIT, the University of California, Berkeley, the Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco, Harvard University, and Prairie
View A&M University. SynBERC aims to build biological components
and assemble them into integrated systems to accomplish specific
tasks (SynBERC, 2006; Medgadget, 2006). About 15 percent of the
funds spent on synthetic biology have been provided by sources in
Canada, Japan, Israel, India, the EU, France, Austria, Denmark, Ger-
many, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.

In the context of the 6th Framework program, the European Commis-
sion has developed the PATHFINDER initiative to stimulate forward-
looking, cross-disciplinary research to demonstrate key principles
and generate tools and parts for synthetic biology (European Commis-
sion, 2005b). In the first two calls a total of 8 projects were funded
(see Appendix 1). A third call has already been evaluated as well; 
there will be 1 Coordination Action, 2 Specific Support Actions and 
6 Specific Targeted Research Projects.

In terms of funding sources, the present situation in synthetic biology
is quite similar to the situation in genetic engineering in the 1970s. 
To date, public institutions have been the main sources of funding for
research activities in synthetic biology. Private enterprises are pri-
marily represented by small companies, usually university spin-offs,
delivering enabling technologies, such as gene synthesis and auto-
mated high-throughput systems. As the use of synthetic genes in any
type of genetic research is time saving, natural genes are increasingly
substituted by synthetic genes. The world market for gene synthesis
is roughly divided among five companies: Blue Heron, Codon Devices,
Coda Genomics, DNA2.0, and Germany based Geneart. Most of them
are university spin-offs and work in close cooperation with universi-
ties. Software and electronic hardware producers such as Oracle,
Intel, and IBM deliver powerful systems that can do the computational
work. 

Pharmaceutical, energy, biochemical and eventually agbiotech compa-
nies such as Merck, Pfizer, Chevron, Genencor, DSM, Cargill, and Syn-
genta are the (potential) end users of synthetic biology. So far, these
end users do not seem to play a significant role in synthetic biology
development, which is probably due to the early stage of development
and the uncertainties of applicability.

From a business perspective, synthetic biology is typically in a stage
where development of new technologies and business initiatives
attracts mainly high-risk capital investment. Therefore it is not sur-
prising that the Berkeley Conference in May 2006 was sponsored by
several venture capital firms that are active in the field of life sci-
ences (biopharmaceuticals), energy and materials.

universities and research institutes. Judging by the list of participants

community consists of about 500 people (including students), mainly
scientists from US-based universities and public research institutes.
Their scientific background is primarily in molecular biology, chem-
istry, computing & informatics and engineering. Most of the US-based
work is in the Boston area (where the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology is located), around Berkeley in California and at Craig Venter’s
Institute for Genomic Research in Maryland. Other major players are
the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, Harvard
Medical School, the John Hopkins University, and the US Department
of Energy. The BioBricks Foundation and the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory play a key role in getting the community orga-
nized on issues such as standardization and self-regulation.

Another key player is the J. Craig Venter Institute, home to approxi-
mately 200 staff and scientists with expertise in human and 
evolutionary biology, genetics, bioinformatics/informatics, high-
throughput DNA sequencing, information technology, and genomic
and environmental policy research. Hamilton Smith, Nobel Laureate,
leads a synthetic biology group that includes National Academy of 
Sciences members Craig Venter and Clyde Hutchison, one of the pio-
neers of molecular biology who developed site-directed mutagenesis
techniques. The Institute’s areas of scientific focus include: genomic
medicine with an emphasis on cancer genomics and human genome
resequencing and analysis; environmental genomic analysis with an
emphasis on microbial biodiversity, ecology, and evolution; use of
molecular and genomic methods to develop biological sources of
clean energy; synthetic genome development; and policy research 
on the ethical, legal, and economic issues associated with genomic
science and technology. The team at the Venter Institute is concen-
trating on new methodologies to synthesize large segments of DNA
that will eventually enable the construction of whole artificial 
chromosomes. The Synthetic Biology Group is also interested in
understanding and thus engineering new pathways that could lead to
new methods for carbon sequestration purposes. By synthesizing
minimal genomes the team believes it is possible to construct simple
cellular life with desirable synthetic properties (J. Craig Venter 
Institute, 2006).

The BIO FAB Group, a group of people from eight US universities
(Baker, 2006), is also playing an important role, especially in further-
ing the idea of Biobricks. Members are:
• David Baker, professor of biochemistry at the University of 
Washington, specialized in protein folding mechanisms and 
protein-protein interactions

• George Church, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School 

and Director of the Lipper Center for Computational Genetics

• Jim Collins, professor of biomedical engineering at Boston 

University

A European Synbio community – in the sense of researchers branding
themselves as ‘synthetic biologists’ and feeling connected to this field
– is still very small. At present, most European scientists and research
institutes that are involved in synthetic biology research consider
their activities an extension of systems biology, of applied research
such as cancer research, or of technologies such as nano(bio)technol-
ogy, and genetic engineering. A statistical review of synthetic biology
research in Europe and North America shows that most fields in syn-
thetic biology are dominated by US-based researchers. European
research is particularly strong in the area of analysis and modeling of
molecular networks (Synbiology, 2005).

In October 2005, the European Science Foundation organized an
exploratory workshop on synthetic biology in biocatalysis and
biodegradation. It was aimed at setting up a transnational, European-
wide framework for future cooperative projects that bundle the vari-
ous expertises and concertedly work towards the translation of this
joint know-how into concrete technological and economical develop-
ments (European Science Foundation, 2005).

involved in modern biotechnological research. However this has yet
to be explored systematically.

Other important key players include government institutions and

US National Institute of Health, the US Department of Defense, the US
Department of Environment, and the European Commission. The US
Department of Agriculture was represented at the Berkeley 2006 con-
ference, mainly because of the market potentials for agricultural com-
modities. During a Synbiology seminar on May 30, 2006, in Brussels,
recommendations for stronger synthetic biology research were dis-
cussed. Six major challenges for the next 5 years were identified:
• Ensure security and safety
• Establish and achieve goal for DNA synthesis: low cost, very fast

synthesis, no errors

• Develop robust set of well characterized “standard” parts
• Develop tests for quality control of “standard” parts
• Set funding priorities in context of long term/high cost research
• Identify achievable goals resulting in tangible products

Foundational technologies, health care, materials, environmental
applications, energy, chemistry, and agricultural biotechnology were
considered priority areas. Apart from funding priorities for the Euro-
pean Commission (core facilities, equipment), the question about how
to attract private funding was raised (big business, new technology-
based firms, equity funding). Training and education were discussed,
as well as intellectual property rights and legal issues. Building coop-
eration with North America and Asia was given special attention. This
requires identification of the barriers and ways to overcome them, of
parties interested in cooperation versus competition for a future
growth market, and of common priorities with buy-in from senior offi-
cials of funding agencies in both regions. Funding of joint symposia
and workshops, of collaborative research projects, and for EU post-
docs to train/teach in North America was suggested (Synbiology,
2006).

So far, NGOs have not been represented at any of the international
conferences and seminars. Nevertheless, it was in the context of a
critical analysis of nanotechnology and converging technologies in
2004 that the action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration
(ETC) put synthetic biology on the agenda (ETC, 2004). ETC supports
socially responsible developments of technologies useful to the poor
and marginalized and addresses international governance issues and
corporate power. In the field of life sciences, the organization cam-
paigns against patents on life and the use of terminator technologies
that create plants producing non-reproducible seeds. The ETC Group
was probably one of the initiators of a letter sent to the organizers of
the Berkeley Conference, in which 35 NGOs protested against a self-
regulation initiative of the scientific community (see Chapter 5.3).
The NGO protest is a clear elaboration of their protest against genetic
engineering.

5 Social, ethical, and
legal aspects

At present, the scientific community and research programs are plac-
ing a strong emphasis on the risk and security aspects of synthetic
biology. The risk debate seems to focus on the differences between
genetic engineering and synthetic biology. The context of the security
debate is typical post 9/11, and appears to be more of an issue in the
United States and the UK than in continental Europe (Schmidt, 2006).

For both risk and security, the scientific community is seeking a
system of self-regulation analogous to the Asilomar Conference in
1975. However, several analysts challenge the effectiveness of the
Asilomar approach under the present conditions. Some of them point
at significant changes in the power structure of Western society
during the past 30 years. Others argue that the present situation con-
cerning the distribution of knowledge and materials is totally differ-
ent from 1975, which makes a moratorium virtually impossible.
Moreover, intellectual property rights were not yet an issue in 1975,
and the ‘September 11 effect’ in the United States means that people
are far more aware of biosecurity issues nowadays. This chapter
analyses these similarities and differences between Asilomar (1975)
and the present debate (2006) in more detail.

5 . 1  P a r a l l e l  w i t h  A s i l o m a r,  1 9 7 5

Prior to the 2nd International Synthetic Biology Conference in May
2006 several members from the scientific community were inter-
viewed about biosafety and biosecurity issues. A paper was drafted,
which was meant to be the starting point for a debate about improve-
ments in safety and security in synthetic biology by means of self-reg-
ulation (Maurer, 2006). The present emphasis on risks, security, and
self-governance by the scientific community is reminiscent of the
Asilomar Conference in 1975. In the early 1970s, the molecular biol-
ogy community responded to the controversial development of
genetic engineering by making a series of decisions that resulted in an
international scientific conference at the Asilomar Conference Center,
California, in February 1975. This conference established the pattern
of American policy for controlling the field and served as an influen-
tial precedent for policy making abroad. 

The Asilomar Conference has been lauded as an exceptional event in

which scientists voluntarily sacrificed immediate progress in their
research to ensure that the field would develop safely. Yet according
to Suzan Wright, who wrote a critical analysis of Asilomar, many, per-
haps most, of the participants resisted questions raised about the
implications of their work and simply wanted to proceed. Self-inter-
est, not altruism, was most evident at Asilomar. Eyewitness accounts
(and the conference tapes) make it clear that all moves to address the
social problems posed by this field in advance of its development
were firmly suppressed (Wright, 2001). 

The culture in science, stressing individual autonomy, freedom and
creativity of research as a free speech act, makes the scientific com-
munity allergic for government interference. The initiative presented
at the Berkeley Conference reflected a strong mistrust of politicians
and government regulators among scientists, especially in the US. 
The view that “an attempt to ban or limit access to DNA synthesis
technology, and the sequence information that defines what to syn-
thesize, would only be guaranteed to cripple biological engineering
research and hinder biomedical research” is widely shared in the syn-
thetic biology community. Therefore, the community’s answer to the
problem of dual use is self-regulation, which includes the develop-
ment of general, agile capabilities for detecting, understanding and
responding to biological risks (Maurer, 2006). David Baltimore, virolo-
gist and Nobel prize winner, president of the California Institute of
Technology, and one of the organizers of the Asilomar Conference,
explains why it was felt so important not to have regulation on geneti-
cally engineered organisms in 1975: “After conclusions from the 
conference had been drawn, the results were handed over to the
National Institute of Health (NIH), who then established a Recombi-
nant DNA Advisory Committee. This was important because the NIH
could continually judge scientific evidence, which is something that
regulators could not do. Legislation would have been fixed, and you
would have had to go back to the legislators to unfix, which is very
difficult to achieve” (Baltimore, 2006: webcast). In a review article in
Nature, November 2005, Drew Endy writes: “Because technologies for
engineering biology will be openly developed and widely distributed,
political leadership is needed to encourage all members of society to
help actively foster a worldwide community that celebrates the 
science of biology, and lead the overwhelmingly constructive devel-
opment and application of future biological technologies” (Endy,
2005).

According to Paul Rabinow, social-cultural anthropologist at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley, Asilomar took place at a time that elite
was ranked around status, not around money (Rabinow, 2005). The
funding came from the federal government and it was mainly the
American University system that was involved. Dissemination of sci-
entific results took place through commercial, but high-status media,

48

such as Science, Nature and The New York Times. It was the elite scien-
tists that were convinced they should regulate science. The trick of
Asilomar was to turn ‘danger’ into ‘safety’. By giving the assessment to
the National Institute of Health, the matter was no longer a scientist
problem and became a political problem, according to Rabinow. In
2006, the hierarchy of the system is no longer based on status, but on
power, and the autonomy of science is limited by financial, legal and
ethical constraints, Rabinow argues. That makes a scientist-only gath-
ering, even if it were only to discuss the technology end, unaccept-
able. Also Baltimore indicates that our society is a different place
compared to 1975, and the scientific community could no longer
make decisions without involving other parties (Baltimore, 2006: 
webcast).

Rabinow’s remarks were almost instantly illustrated by a joint letter
of 35 NGOs (including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, the Canadian
Farmers Union, ETC Group, the International Center for Technology
Assessment, the Indigenous People’s Biodiversity Network and the
Third World Network) that criticized the attempt for self-regulation by
the scientific community at the 2nd Synthetic Biology Conference in
May 2006. The letter was sent to the organizers and the press the day
before the start of the conference, and emphasized that (ETC, 2006):
1. Society – especially social movements and marginalized peoples –
must be fully engaged in designing and directing societal dialogue
on every aspect of synthetic biology research and products.
Because of the extraordinary power and scope of synthetic biology
technologies, this discussion must take place globally, nationally
and locally.

2. Scientific self-governance does not work and is antidemocratic. It is

not for scientists to have the determinant voice in regulating their
research or their products.

3. The development of synthetic biology technologies must be evalu-
ated for their broader socioeconomic, cultural, health and environ-
mental implications and not simply for their misuse in the hands of
‘evildoers.’

One of the intentions of the organizers of the Berkeley Conference
was to vote on a common declaration at the last day of the conference.
However, without an explanation from the organizers, the decision
was taken not to have such a vote and to place the text on the website
for further written comments. This may be considered a sign that the
organizers are reasonably receptive to critical comments, both from
inside and from outside the scientific community.

Other similarities and differences will be discussed in the following
sections.

Like genetic engineering, synthetic biology could pose a risk to other
organisms, especially when new organisms are released to the envi-
ronment or used in feed, food or medical/veterinary products. An
analysis of risk definition and the first two conferences on synthetic
biology (2004 and 2006) show that there is a lot of similarity between
discussions in 1975 and the present debate on synthetic biology.
However, there is one important difference: in 1975 the access to the
relevant knowledge and technologies was limited, whereas nowadays
the knowledge and technologies are widely disseminated, which
makes it virtually impossible to implement a moratorium.

One of the main questions is how these potential risks should be man-
aged. Because of similarities with the risks of genetic engineering,
risk management is focusing on how synthetic biology changes preex-
isting risks for better or for worse. At present, opinions on the ade-
quacy of the system designed for the risk analysis of GMOs differ.

D e f i n i t i o n  o f  r i s k s

In his analysis of the challenges for synthetic biology, Arjun Bhutkar
outlines the risks of synthetic biology as follows (Bhutkar, 2005):
• Risk of negative environmental impact: This includes scenarios in
which a synthetically created microorganism designed for a partic-
ular task (e.g., environmental cleanup) could have a side effect of
interacting with another environmental substance and impact the
overall environment negatively.

• Risk of natural genome pool contamination: Any genetic exchange
between a synthetic biological entity and a naturally-occurring bio-
logical entity would result in natural genome contamination. This is
similar to the problem of “gene flow” in the context of transgenic
plants.

• Run-off risk (“Grey goo” and “green goo” problem): This is similar to
the problem often discussed in the context of nanotechnology. Syn-
thetic biology products released into the environment to accom-
plish a specific task should have a controlled lifespan outside the
lab. If this in not the case, one can envision unintended conse-
quences of a system run amuck.

According to Michele Garfinkel, biosafety expert of the J. Craig Venter
Institute, this list is incomplete – for instance, it does not explicitly
include worker safety – and does not distinguish effectively between
natural, bioengineered and synthetic organisms.

Similar to the Asilomar Conference in 1975, most scientists involved
in synthetic biology nowadays consider the creation and accidental
release of new human pathogens the biggest threat. During the Berke-

ley 2006 conference the possibility of unintended effects caused by
the deliberate release of synthetic biology products to the environ-
ment (Bhutkar’s first category of risks) was not discussed, probably
because it is not considered an issue at this stage of the technology’s
development. The present focus on ‘accidents’ and references to work
that is already needed given existing and emerging infectious dis-
eases, reflects the strong focus on human health risks caused by
experiments in more or less contained environments. 

MIT, the Venter Institute, and the Center for Strategic and Interna-
tional Studies in Washington, D.C., have teamed up to examine issues
such as how to keep any new life forms created under control. This
effort is funded by a $570,000, 15-month grant from the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation and will be completed in autumn 2006 (Pennisi,
2005). Nonetheless, the near absence of ecologists who might raise a
few questions on this issue in the present debate is also quite similar
to the situation in 1975. In the Netherlands, for instance, it was only
in the late 1980s that ecologists’ opinions on the deliberate or acci-
dental release of genetically modified organisms were first heard. 

In 2006 an EU-funded project will start aimed at addressing bioethical
and biosafety concerns, and potential or perceived risks and benefits
of synthetic biology from the very beginning. This Synbiosafe project
will start with a fact-finding exercise, including a series of interviews
with synthetic biologists and biosafety experts, and an exploration of
upcoming biosafety challenges by two task groups. Secondly, and
based on this fact-finding exercise, a reference framework will be pre-
pared by a number of task groups that will serve as the major input
for a contribution to the “inaugural” International Conference on Syn-
thetic Biology in Zurich, an open e-forum and an international meet-
ing on safety and ethics in synthetic biology (Synbiosafe project
objectives).

R i s k  m a n a g e m e n t

Assuming that preexisting risks are known and understood, the
authors of the self-regulation paper discussed in Berkeley argue that
policy should be formulated by focusing on how synthetic biology
impacts preexisting risks in a positive or negative sense. This means
focusing on areas where synthetic biology potentially introduces
qualitatively new pathways for accidents (Maurer, 2006).

The definition of risks related to synthetic biology and, consequently,
the need for specific risk management measures, depends on the defi-
nition of synthetic biology. According to the Forum Genforschung of
the Swiss Academy of Sciences, synthetic biology is considered a new
research field, which usually involves more genes and results in
changes that are more radical than those resulting from genetic modi-

fication. In spite of this difference, with respect to safety, the Forum
argues that synthetic biology is similar to gene technology and can be
understood as a subdiscipline of the latter. From this rather inconsis-
tent argumentation the Forum draws the conclusion that in general,
the creation of synthetic organisms is no more risky than the intro-
duction of new species into an ecosystem, dealing with natural
pathogens or gene technology as practiced to date. Thus, the criteria
that apply for the risk assessment of genetic modification also apply
to synthetic biology. The following questions should therefore be
explored on a case-by-case basis:
• What is the function of the new biological systems?
• What can these do?
• Could they reproduce independently in the natural environment?
• Could they infect the cells of other living organisms and reproduce

there?

• Does the new combination of the gene trigger any unexpected

effects?

The Forum Genforschung continues by observing that current devel-
opments in synthetic biology are all intended for use in laboratories
or chemical-pharmaceutical plants. If, despite rigorous safety precau-
tions, organisms modified in this way were to be introduced into the
environment, new pathogens could in principle arise from them. How-
ever, the more a new organism differs from natural life forms, the less
likely it is to reproduce outside of the laboratory. For example, in
order to increase safety, self-reproducing biological systems can be
constructed such that they require a nutrient that does not occur nat-
urally or that the gene cannot function in natural organisms. 

Future developments of synthetic organisms for use in patients or in
the environment must be tested thoroughly for safety. As is the case
with natural pathogens or existing genetically modified organisms,
experimental tests and well-controlled clinical tests or release tests
are essential for ensuring that the relevant detailed safety informa-
tion is provided (Forum Genforschung, 2005). 

Tucker and Zilinskas do not share the view of the Forum Genforschung.
They agree that for the near future at least, the vast majority of syn-
thetic biological systems will be engineered by transferring small
genetic circuits into a well-understood bacterial host, and therefore
the familiarity principle will apply. The experience with the micro-
organisms used for genetic engineering, such as the bacterium E. coli
and the yeast S. cerevisiae, which are well understood by scientists,
proves that the transfer of one or two foreign genes is unlikely to
change the characteristics of the host in a dramatic, unpredictable
way. The use of familiar organisms, which are largely identical to the
original organism after being slightly altered, limits the level of risk.
Yet a decade from now, they argue, synthetic genomes may be assem-

bled from BioBricks that have been redesigned or are entirely artifi-
cial, having been created de novo. If a synthetic microorganism is
built by combining these genetic elements in a new way, it will lack a
clear genetic pedigree and could have “emergent properties” arising
from the complex interactions of its constituent genes. Accordingly,
the risks attending the accidental release of such an organism from
the laboratory would be extremely difficult to assess in advance,
including its possible spread into new ecological niches and the evo-
lution of novel and potentially harmful characteristics (Tucker, 2006). 

This is probably what makes the Dutch Advisory Committee on
Genetic Modification (COGEM) less certain about the adequacy of the
present system designed for the risk analysis of GMOs for dealing
with risks related to synthetic biology. It has therefore formulated
several questions that require more study, such as:
• If the present system for risk analysis for GMOs is not adequate,

can it be adapted? If so, in what sense should it be adapted?

• What information is needed about the traits of an organism to make

a proper risk analysis?

• Should risk analysis distinguish between totally synthetic 

organisms and new organisms based on existing organisms?
• How can risks of synthetic genes and organisms be analyzed 

without having a natural reference? (COGEM, 2006)

Some researchers are already exploring strategies to incorporate safe-
guards. For example, Church and Endy are developing ways to prevent
synthetic genes from escaping and possibly wreaking havoc. One
solution: Alter synthetic genetic codes such that they are incompati-
ble with natural ones because there is a mismatch in the genes coding
for amino acids (Pennisi, 2005). 

Nevertheless, Tucker and Zilinskas think there are still too many
uncertainties about the effectiveness of such built-in control mecha-
nisms and the testing of pathogenicity of synthetic organisms in
animal models. Therefore, the “precautionary principle” should be
adopted, which means that synthetic microorganisms are treated as
dangerous until proven harmless. According to this approach, all
organisms containing assemblies of BioBricks would have to be stud-
ied under a high level of biocontainment (Biosafety Level 3 or even 4)
until their safety could be demonstrated in a definitive manner
Tucker, 2006). Biosafety Level 4 is required for work with dangerous
and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of aerosol-transmit-
ted laboratory infections and life-threatening disease. Agents with a
close or identical antigenic relationship to Biosafety Level 4 agents
are handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to
confirm continued work at this level, or to work with them at a lower
level. Biosafety Level 3 is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching,
research, or production facilities in which work is done with indige-

nous or exotic agents that may cause serious or potentially lethal dis-
ease as a result of exposure by the inhalation route (CDC, 1999).

5 . 3   B i o s e c u r i t y

Apart from the risks mentioned above, the risk of the creation of
deadly pathogens for the purposes of bioterrorism is widely recog-
nized by the scientific community. From this perspective, David 
Baltimore argues, the present situation is obviously different from
Asilomar, 1975. In 1975 the scientists believed that there was a treaty
not to use biology for making weapons to which everybody was adher-
ing. Now we know that the former USSR had a large program for devel-
oping and testing biological weapons. But more important is the
change of the source of threat: instead of states the world has to deal
with terrorist organizations that cross boundaries, and who are not
held up by treaties (Baltimore, 2006: webcast). Therefore, it is the
contention of the community of self-identified synbiologists that the
potential for harm, even for the development of weapons capable of
“mass destruction,” is not trivial. The creation of the complete
genome of the polio virus in the lab, which was proven to be infec-
tious, has demonstrated the potential of synthetic biology to engineer
harmful pathogens (Cello, 2002). This technology, in rogue hands,
could be used to engineer the genomes of deadly pathogens. Never-
theless, specialists seem to disagree about the new threats synthetic
biology is posing in terms of bioterrorism or biological warfare. In
general, and probably due to the devastating and shocking events on
9/11, the risk of bioterrorist attacks seems to be experienced differ-
ently in the US than in Europe (Schmidt, 2006).

The Ethics of Genomics Group notes that the combination of large-
scale sequencing of human pathogens, determination of function of
disease-associated gene products, and development of technologies
to assemble large pieces of DNA could lead to the creation or release
of organisms that could be used as biological weapons. The dangers
of knowing the sequences of extremely deadly pathogens could pose
threats to public health and safety that might outweigh the benefits
(Cho, 1999).

In a paper that was distributed a few weeks before the 2nd Synthetic
Biology Conference in May 2006, Raymond Zilinskas, head of the
Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Program, shows
the technological difficulties in creating an organism that is patho-
genic (Zilinskas, 2006). Pathogenicity requires that an organism is
sufficiently infective, virulent, can survive before and after release, is
resistant towards drugs and vaccines, and is specific in its preference
to a specific host. The formulation (agents protecting the organism
while it is in the environment), containers for storage and transport

(munition), and methods for dispersion (by aerosol, by injection, by
explosion, or by food and beverages) have to be carefully chosen. 
And very important: the behavior of a synthetic organism in the open
environment has to be measured and observed and the dispersal
system has to be tested, which requires field-testing, again not an
easy task.

Notwithstanding these limitations, it needs only one successful
attempt to create a threat. This may be why the Swiss Forum Gen-
forschung has adopted an ambivalent position on the issue of bio-
security. The Forum argues that the possibility of the abusive and
criminal application of synthetic biology, for example for bioterror-
ism, is negligible. One of the arguments is that many potential biolog-
ical weapons can already be found among the natural pathogens
which require little effort to produce and use. Further to date, few
attempts to produce and use biological weapons have been success-
ful. Despite this, the Swiss Forum Genforschung continues, it may
make sense to consider what kind of mechanisms exist or should be
created to cover such activities. 

The Ethics of Genomics Group advises ensuring the responsible use of
knowledge that could be applied to the construction of biological
weapons, by giving serious thought to monitoring and regulation at
the level of national and international public policy. Should we regu-
late the science, and if so, at the level of specifying which genomes
will be sequenced or at the level of access to the sequence informa-
tion? Or will we regulate the application of the science? 

According to Laurie Zoloth of the Center for Bioethics, Science and
Society, oversight of ‘problematical dual use’ in the US has been
inconsistent (Zoloth, 2006). She refers to Milton Leitenberg, who
noted in 2005 that: The entire area of oversight and problematic “dual
use” research in molecular genetics and its applications in the United
States appears to range from inadequate at the local levels to virtually
nonexistent at the national level and in terms of BWC treaty compli-
ance.” (Leitenberg, 2005). Nevertheless, the National Academy of Sci-
ences has recommended that seven categories of “experiments of
concern” be added to the NIH oversight process. In response to the
recommendations of the NAS committee report, the administration
announced the establishment of a National Science Advisory Board for
BioSecurity (NSABB) on March 4, 2004. Its mandate was to last for 2
years. The NSABB has been established to provide advice to federal
departments and agencies on ways to minimize the possibility that
knowledge and technologies emanating from vitally important biolog-
ical research will be misused to threaten public health or national
security. The NSABB (2006) is a critical component of a set of federal
initiatives to promote biosecurity in life sciences research, and is
charged specifically with guiding the development of:

• A system of institutional and federal research review that allows for

fulfillment of important research objectives while addressing
national security concerns; 

• Guidelines for the identification and conduct of research that may

require special attention and security surveillance; 

• Professional codes of conduct for scientists and laboratory workers
that can be adopted by professional organizations and institutions
engaged in life sciences research; 

• Materials and resources to educate the research community about

effective biosecurity; and 

• Strategies for fostering international collaboration for the effective

oversight of dual use biological research. 

Proposed actions that are further discussed on the Internet site of the
US synthetic biology community are (Maurer, 2006):
1. Insist That All Commercial Gene Synthesis Houses Adopt Current

Best Practice Screening Procedures. While most gene synthesis com-
panies screen orders for dangerous sequences, a few do not. This
gives both community members and outsiders access to feedstocks
for both wild type and genetically-engineered bioweapons. Commu-
nity members should stop doing business with any gene synthesis
company that fails to implement current best-practice screening
methods by January 1, 2007. 

2. Create and Endorse New Watch-Lists To Improve Industry Screening
Programs. Improved watch-lists and software tools can make indus-
try screening more accurate and efficient. Members should prepare
the necessary lists and tools in time for Synthetic Biology 3.0. 

3. Create a Confidential Hotline For Biosafety and Biosecurity Issues.
All experimenters contemplating “experiments of concern” should
obtain independent expert advice before proceeding. The commu-
nity should make such advice freely available to all experimenters,
including non-members (e.g., hackers) who cannot otherwise obtain
such advice from formal university, company, or NIH safety com-
mittees. 

4. Affirm Members’ Ethical Obligation to Investigate and Report Dan-
gerous Behavior. Members have an obligation to investigate and, if
necessary, report dangerous behavior. Members should affirm this
obligation by formal resolution at Synthetic Biology 2.0. 

5. Create a Community-Wide Clearinghouse for Identifying and Track-

ing Potential Biosafety/Biosecurity Issues. Members who notice
potential biosecurity issues have an obligation to share them with
the broader community. A central clearinghouse will help the com-
munity to identify, track, and if necessary respond to the
biosafety/biosecurity implications of a changing technology. 

6. Endorse Biosecurity/Biosafety R&D Priorities. New technologies can
potentially reduce current biosafety/biosecurity risks even further.
Members should identify, endorse, and urge funding agencies to
invest in priority technologies such as safe chasses and bar codes.

The building of new organisms also raises intellectual property and
commercialization issues that will affect the conduct of research and
the ability of both industry and academia to continue developing the
technology for public good. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is
another area where the situation has changed drastically during the
past 30 years. In 1975 intellectual property rights was not yet on the
agenda of the scientists involved in genetic engineering. Nowadays,
most technologies used in genetic engineering and applications are
patented by the companies and research institutes that invented
them. Patents ensure the holder control over the technology and,
eventually, legal protection that ensures return on investment. There-
fore, patents are considered an important instrument for encouraging
investment in technological innovation. On the other hand, the legal
work that is involved in ensuring that all patents involving the use of
specific technologies and materials in research are properly dealt
with – in terms of permissions and fees – can be so enormous, that it
is practically impossible for research institutes to use them. In addi-
tion, patent holders may ask for information about materials to
remain confidential, resulting in scientific publications that lack
essential information.

In the United States, the precedent for patents for altered organisms
was set by the Chakrabarty case, which ruled that a genetically altered
bacterium was not a product of nature and thus was patentable (Dia-
mond versus Chakrabarty, 1980). Prior to this case, the US Congress
had authorized limited protection for cultivated plant varieties, and
in 1988 the US Patent and Trade Office granted the first patent for an
animal; the Harvard Onco-mouse (Shorett, 2002). Although it took a
long time for the European Union to create harmonized patent legisla-
tion, the European Patent Office has granted a large number of patents
on genetically modified organisms.

In order to avoid limitations in research and education, experimental
use exemption from patent infringement exists for university
research. But in a recent case in the United States, the Federal Circuit
found that major research universities often sanction and fund
research projects with arguably no commercial application whatso-
ever. Yet these projects also further the institution’s business objec-
tives, including educating and enlightening students and faculty
participating in these projects. These projects also serve, for exam-
ple, to increase the status of the institution and lure lucrative
research grants, students and faculty staff. In short, the profit or non-
profit status of the user is not determinative. Only when the act of the
alleged infringer is for amusement, to satisfy idle curiosity, or for
strictly philosophical inquiry, does the act qualify for the very narrow
and strictly limited experimental use defense. (Stephens, 2003).

However, it is not clear how far reaching patents on any newer meth-
ods to create genetically altered organisms will be, or how patents on
individual genes will be reconciled if many of the genes are used in a
newly assembled genome. Current patenting practices may already be
restricting development of and access to clinical applications of
genomics, as well as academic and industrial researchers’ access to
genetic information and reagents. Large-scale gene identification
efforts such as those involved in minimal genome research, as well as
other technologies that require use of large numbers of genes simulta-
neously (such as gene arrays) have great potential to exacerbate these
problems. 

Both the US and the EU patent system use criteria for patents such as
utility, moral utility doctrine, and licensing. Utility requires that a
claimed invention either has a well-established utility or asserts a
specific, substantial, and credible utility (European Patent Law
requires that to be patentable an invention must have industrial
applicability) (Biojudiciary.org, 2006; European Patent Office, 2003).
In terms of the BioBricks stratification of parts-devices-systems (see
the figure “Building systems with parts and devices” in Chapter 2.2.),
it could be argued that higher levels of integration (devices and sys-
tems) can easily be conceived to serve some aggregate complex func-
tion, such as environmental cleanup of a specific pollutant (Bhutkar,
2005). Bhutkar suggests that the lowest level of parts should be engi-
neered for well-defined functions and a clear beneficial purpose
should be articulated wherever possible, in order to easily meet util-
ity requirements at higher levels of integration.

The US moral utility doctrine requires that the invention should not
be frivolous or injurious to the well being, good policy, or sound
morals of society. It is a rarely invoked aspect of patent law in the US.
One of the few exceptions was the rejection of Dr Newman and Jeremy
Rifkin’s human-chimera patent application in 1998 on the basis that it
embraced a human being and thus was not patentable (Newman,
2002). Article 53(a) of the European Patent Convention notes that:
“The EPO will not grant patents against public order or morality.”
(European Patent Office, 1991) It is expected that in Europe, creations
of synthetic biology will face tougher scrutiny from a patentability
perspective.

Given the legal possibilities for patent protection and the potentially
far reaching consequences for furthering the research in synthetic
biology, it is not surprising that access to technologies and materials
is high on the agenda of the research community. The question then,
is how to design a regulatory framework that protects intellectual
property in a way that stimulates innovation whilst not hindering
basic research. As Bhutkar has pointed out (Bhutkar, 2005), patent
policy is not a barrier to research efforts and regulatory frameworks

are a primary tool for ensuring that proper safeguards are instituted
and researcher conduct adheres to established guidelines.

Several initiatives have started and proposals have been put forward
for a new regulatory framework for intellectual property pertaining to
genes and organisms, to ensure that public and commercial interests
are protected. One of the goals of BioBricks is to develop and imple-
ment legal strategies to ensure that BioBricks remain freely available
to the public (BioBricks Foundation, 2006). It seems appropriate to
investigate alternatives to the patent system that are being devel-
oped, such as Public-Sector Intellectual Property Resource for Agricul-
ture (PIPRA) and BIOS: ‘Biological Innovation for Open Society’. PIPRA
is an initiative of US-based public research institutes involved in agro-
biotech research that wants to map the patenting and licensing prac-
tices of the public sector and create a common patent database. PIPRA
also wants to develop ‘shared technology packages’ of key technolo-
gies for agbiotech research (Atkinson, 2003). Richard Jefferson, a
geneticist from the US, is the driving force behind BIOS. BIOS wants to
promote the use of agbiotech patents as a kind of freeware, compara-
ble to what has been done with Linux in the field of software develop-
ment. One of the first steps was the development of an alternative for
the use of the commercially patented Agrobacterium thumefaciens
method for plant transformation (Broothaerts, 2005). However, a 
Syngenta plant scientist has made some critical comments on the 
efficiency of the use of bacterium strains other than Agrobacterium in
Nature Biotechnology (Chilton, 2005). She refers to the publication of
the experiments with non-Agrobacterium transformation methods,
which demonstrate a frequency of successful transformations in 
Arabidopsis thaliana and rice of 10–100 times lower than has been
achieved with Agrobacterium methods.

Meanwhile, with some funding of the Rockefeller Foundation and IBM,
CAMBIA, the organization charged with applying the idea of BIOS, got
started in 2005 (Carina, 2004). A gift of 2.5 million US dollars from the
Norwegian government enabled CAMBIA to cooperate with the Interna-
tional Rice Research Institute in December 2005 in creating a freely
accessible database of rice-related patents in Korea, China and India
(CAMBIA, 2005).

Thinking about the philosophical aspect of synthetic biology, one of
the first questions that arises is: “What is life?”. The distinction
between an engineered machine and a living organism is clearly one
of the main ethical concerns. In 1975, the organizers of the Asilomar
Conference did not consider the ethical aspects because they felt
unqualified to do so. David Baltimore, one of the organizers of Asilo-

mar explains: “We did not have ethicists or philosophers (or maybe
only a few) at the conference, and we were not pretending to speak for
the public” (Baltimore, 2006: webcast). Although ethical concerns
were put on the agenda of the Berkeley Conference in 2006, little spe-
cific analysis has been made of the ethical implications of synthetic
biology. Papers that mention the ethical aspects usually do not elabo-
rate on them, and are restricted to raising questions in a rather unsys-
tematic sense, or focus on the ethical behavior of the research
community with respect to biosecurity and biosafety.

One of the few ethical reviews of minimal genome synthesis is from
the Ethics of Genomics Group, and was published in Science in 1999
(Cho, 1999). This group articulated questions such as: “How does
work on minimal genomes and the creation of new free-living organ-
isms change how we frame ideas of life and our relationship to it?”
and “How can the technology be used for the benefit of all, and what
can be done in law and social policy to ensure that outcome?”.

According to this group, the attempt to model and create a minimal
genome represents the culmination of a reductionist research agenda
about the meaning and origin of life that has spanned the twentieth
century. There are important concerns raised by this reductionist
approach to understanding life. First, a reductionist approach can
limit our scientific understanding of living organisms. Focusing on a
reductionist approach has had some historical value in helping scien-
tists produce a better understanding of cellular function: it provides
information on some of the crucial functions necessary for cellular
function, as well as insight into the evolutionary process. In spite of
its usefulness, however, reductionism has also led to erroneous think-
ing, for example, that viruses were the phylogenetic precursors to cel-
lular life. Similarly, by devoting far greater effort to understanding
the role of the nucleus in the functioning of the cell compared with
other cellular elements, which have their own causal roles to play, we
can bias our understanding of how cells operate. Second, a reduction-
ist understanding of life, especially human life, is not satisfying to
those who believe that dimensions of the human experience cannot be
explained by an exclusively physiological analysis. What are the ulti-
mate implications of defining life in terms of DNA? Should we allow
the definition of life to be treated as a narrow scientific issue, one
that assumes that there is nothing in the world that is not physical?
Can or should those in the natural sciences decide the meaning of life
without input from theologians, philosophers, social scientists, and
the general public? There is a serious danger that the identification
and synthesis of minimal genomes will be presented by scientists,
depicted in the press, or perceived by the public as proving that life is
reducible to or nothing more than DNA. But life need not be under-
stood solely in terms of what technology permits natural scientists to
discover. This may threaten the view that life is special, that there is

60

e

interconnectedness of all living things, and the sense that living
things are, in some important way, more than organized matter. 

Reducing life to genes has profound implications for several critical
societal debates, including what constitutes human life and when life
begins. It is important that scientists and the general public under-
stand the implications and limits of the claims being made by the sci-
entific community about minimal genomes in order to participate
effectively in the debates. As an example, scientists have suggested
application of the minimal genome approach to higher organisms. If
we extend the reductionism implicit in minimal genome research to a
definition of human life, this has implications for the debate about
whether stem cells, early embryos, or hybrid embryos combining
human DNA with the cellular components of other species are human.
Likewise, a genetic definition of when life begins would have implica-
tions for the abortion debate. We would argue that the complex meta-
physical issues about the status of human beings cannot be discussed
in terms of the presence or absence of a particular set of genes. 

However, the type of ethical concerns described above did not yet
seem to have an important place on the agenda of the synthetic biol-
ogy community. Entering into a dialogue without being aware of fun-
damental differences in ethics is rather pointless. Unless the deeper
background and significance of statements is well understood, includ-
ing one’s own statements, there is a risk of total non-communication.
Therefore, a more structured analysis of ethical concerns will be help-
ful in stimulating this debate within the research community and
between scientists and representatives of the broader public (NGOs),
and politicians.

With respect to understanding the ethics of synthetic biology, it is
useful to mention (at least) two types of ethics: consequentionalism
and deontology.

Consequentialism (the ethics of consequences) concerns the assign-
ment of instrumental values. From a consequentialist perspective, a
morally right action is one that produces good consequences. From a
consequentialistic point of view, synthetic biology will not really
differ from genetic engineering or any other technology, except that
synthetic biology offers new opportunities, and applications will be
considered on a case-by-case basis. In science, consequentialist argu-
ments often prevail.

Deontology (the ethics of principles) concerns the assignment of
intrinsic values. Decisions should be made solely or primarily by con-
sidering one’s duties and the rights of others. Deontology posits the
existence of a priori moral obligations, further suggesting that people
ought to live by a set of permanently defined principles that do not

change merely as a result of a change in circumstances. One of the
most important implications of deontology is that praiseworthy goals
can never justify immoral actions; the ends do not justify the means.
The question is not which type of ethics is correct. Both exist and both
are valid. 

One of the difficulties in applying the deontology approach to syn-
thetic biology is the fluidity of the boundaries between conventional
breeding, ‘classical’ mutation technologies (chemical, radiation),
genetic engineering and synthetic biology. Consequently, the bound-
ary between ‘natural’ and ‘artificial’, between ‘life’ and ‘machine’ is
fluid too. Computer algorithms and programs that process and main-
tain their informational heritage on the material basis of silicon, ful-
fill the criteria of the key features of life, and are termed “artificial
life”. However, it should be noted that in a more stringent definition,
these programs are simulating life but do not actually live. This is due
to the information being structural and the limited or missing congru-
ency of matter. The limitation on the capability of creating higher
orders of life lies in the matter itself. Silicon, an element, having a
crystalline structure is not able to resemble information in its own
structure. Only carbon provides sufficient molecular diversity so that
structural information and matter can exist in an intrinsic marriage
that is self sufficient for forming life. Carbon has the greatest flexibil-
ity and highest number of possible combinatorial molecular self-
arrangements as well as a great variety of arrangements with
hetero-atoms in forming hetero-molecules at temperatures where 
the solvent water is in its liquid form.

However, what would the biological definition of carbon-based life be
if the information maintaining molecule, DNA, could be substituted
with a different molecular species? The possibility of a totally artifi-
cial carbon based life without any resemblance to existing natural
organisms arises from different assumptions.

Bhutkar proposes not only a clear articulation of the instrumental and
intrinsic value, but also to expand the universe one step at a time
(Bhutkar, 2005). This means being mindful of the fact that at higher
levels of integration (moving up from biological parts to biological
systems), there are additional unknowns. Researchers should be care-
ful in proceeding to the next level of classification until the compo-
nent parts at each level of classification are well characterized and
their impact is known.

6 Conclusions and 
points of interest

The key objective of this exploratory paper was to investigate whether
synthetic biology is a development that needs further examination for
its scientific and technological significance and its potential impact
on society. This was done by presenting a picture of the characteris-
tics, key players, (potential) applications and future expectations, as
well as the possible ethical, legal and social implications of synthetic
biology. An impression of the characteristics of synthetic biology was
obtained from a review of the scientific literature and participation in
the 2nd International Synthetic Biology Conference in Berkeley, May
2006. The question focused on the ‘newness’ of the technology, and
fundamental changes in views of biology and life, that is a paradigm
shift. An impression of the assumed capabilities of the technology
was created by presenting current developments in synthetic biology,
including an overview of applications and products and an analysis of
future expectations, including an estimate of their probability. A brief
analysis of the driving forces, the structure and dynamics of the syn-
thetic biology community – scientists, institutions, companies,
authorities, and NGOs – explored where decisions are taken about
research programs, funding, legislation and acceptance by end users.
Social, ethical, and legal issues that may play a role in furthering the
technology and supporting science, or that may trigger social and
political debate were also investigated. Finally, thirty years of experi-
ence with technological, social and legal developments in genetic
engineering was used to formulate suggestions for next steps, which
could be translated in future European activities.

There is no doubt that the involvement of several new, non-biological
scientific and engineering disciplines is what clearly distinguishes
synthetic biology from genetic engineering and ‘classical biology’. So
far genetic modification has, to a certain extent, operated in the con-
text of, and was limited by, what ‘nature’ has to offer in terms of
genetic material, cells and organisms. By contrast, synthetic biology
applies engineering principles to biology, which allows for the
intended design of completely new biomolecular systems by modula-
tion. In other words: synthetic biology represents a shift from genetic
modification to genetic modulation, or from molecular biology to mod-
ular biology. The introduction of the modular approach in biology
implies fundamental changes in the type of questions that are sup-

posed to be asked in biology, how these are structured and the
answers probed for. Therefore, we can speak of a paradigm shift.

Although the outlines of the field have yet to become distinct, syn-
thetic biology could be best described as a relatively new field of
technology, which aims for the engineering of biological components
and systems that do not exist in nature and the re-engineering of
existing biological elements. The intentional design of artificial bio-
logical systems is key to this technology, which includes the design
and synthesis of genes, of mechanisms for genetic regulation, transla-
tion, and replication. The objective is to design and synthesize syn-
thetic and artificial (metabolic) pathways and biomolecules, which
can be produced by partly synthetic or completely artificial organ-
isms. 

Synthetic biology can be viewed as the meeting point of two cultures
in molecular biology: ‘deconstructing life’ and ‘constructing life’. Or,
drawing a parallel with nanotechnology: top-down and bottom-up
approaches. The minimal genome, that is the smallest set of genes an
organism needs to live in a particular environment, is an example of
the ‘deconstructing life’ approach, using genomics tools to find out
how biological systems function. The Biobricks initiative, which dis-
tinguishes three levels of building blocks for constructing synthetic
parts, devices and systems, is an example of the ‘constructing life’
approach. It is an approach that is typical for electrical engineering,
that is the well-defined design of electric circuits. The two approaches
are complementary. In other words, synthetic biology is the merging
of approaches in genetic engineering and electrical engineering.

Synthetic biology evolves with the development of many other tech-
nologies and scientific disciplines, such as systems biology,
nanobiotechnology, and biocomputing. Moreover, in terms of applica-
tion, synthetic biology will converge with other technologies (NBIC).
Therefore, boundaries are fluid.

C u r r e n t  d e v e l o p m e n t s  i n  s y n t h e t i c  b i o l o g y

Synthetic biology is at an early stage of development, which makes it
hard to predict how and to what extent the technology will be applied
in the (near) future. At present, most work is being done on applica-
tions that contain synthetic genes or pathways, which are still close to
natural systems and quite similar to genetic modification. Several sci-
entists stress that there are many technological, legal and commercial
obstacles that must be overcome before the practical applications of
the technology can be realized. Completely synthetic or artificial
organisms are still science fiction. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing
speed of gene analysis and gene synthesis will decrease their costs
and availability, which will speed up the recently started learning

curve. With reasonable certainty, it can be assumed that within the
next ten years, biological technologies will be applied to develop new,
(partly) synthetic biological systems that can operate in contained
environments.

The synthetic biology community consists predominantly of natural
scientists and technologists from different disciplines, most of them
based in the USA. Prestigious universities and institutes such as the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the California Institute
of Technology (CalTech), the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,
the J. Craig Venter Institute, and the Harvard Medical School are lead-
ing lights. At the heart of the Synbio community is the BIO FAB Group,
a group of people from eight US universities. A European Synbio com-
munity does not seem to exist yet. At present, most European scien-
tists and research institutes that are involved in synthetic biology
research consider their activities an extension of systems biology, of
applied research such as cancer research, or of technologies such as
nano(bio)technology, and genetic engineering.

The vast majority of research in the US and in Europe is financed by
public funding. At this stage, commercial involvement concentrates
on the development of supporting technologies, such as DNA synthe-
sis and biocomputing. Potential end users of the technology have yet
to see any tangible results.

The action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC), a
Canada based international group that is dedicated to technology and
human rights issues, seems one of the few activist NGOs that is criti-
cally watching what is going on in synthetic biology. The ETC Group
was probably one of the initiators of a letter sent to the organizers of
the Berkeley Conference, in which 35 NGOs protested against a self-
regulation initiative of the scientific community. The NGOs’ protest
clearly elaborates on their protest against genetic engineering.

The present emphasis put on risks and self-governance by the scien-
tific community is reminiscent of the Asilomar Conference in 1975. It
is the same strong liberty-based, rights theory approach within the
field, stressing individual autonomy, freedom and creativity of
research as a free speech act, which makes the scientific community
allergic for government interference. Nevertheless, the organizers of
the Synthetic Biology 2.0 conference in Berkeley were sensitive to criti-
cal comments of various participants and the NGO letter. This has
most likely contributed to the decision not to vote on a common state-
ment on the third day of the conference in May 2006.

As in 1975, the scientific debate on risks related to synthetic biology
is focused on the question as to whether the current approaches to
the risk assessment of genetically modified organisms are adequate.
For the near future, risk analysis and risk management systems devel-
oped for bioengineered organisms may still apply. Gradually, as the
organisms will contain more synthetic components, the familiarity
principle may no longer apply.

At this stage, the risk debate is also focused on health risks. Ecolo-
gists do not yet play a role in the present debate. 

There are also two distinct differences with the situation in 1975.
Thirty years after Asilomar, in the age of terrorist threats, the scien-
tific community seems far more aware of the necessity to include
biosecurity issues. Biosecurity issues related to synthetic biology are
perceived differently in the US and Europe. In the US, worries about
the abuse of synthetic biology have led to far reaching proposals for
biosecurity management, like the establishment of a National Science
Advisory Board for Biosecurity. Moreover, there is an undefined
awareness of ethical and social aspects, which focuses on the account-
ability of synthetic biologists. The scientific community tends to
translate this accountability into internal codes of conduct. 

P o i n t s  o f  i n t e r e s t

Synthetic biology implies a paradigm shift from molecular to modular
biology. It is important that the government monitors and guides this
development in an appropriate way. The gradual societal embedding
of synthetic biology demands that a set of activities is timely organ-
ised. Below, various elements are listed that need attention.

1. Monitor scientific and technological developments

To guide the new terrain of synthetic biology from a societal per-
spective it is necessary to monitor developments in the field of
science and technology, as well as its related social debate. Pay
attention to claims, promises and perceived threats, and try to do
a reality check.

2. Study scientific and social effects

The introduction of the modular approach in biology implies fun-
damental changes in the type of questions that are supposed to be
asked in biology, how these are structured and the answers
probed for. The impact that such changes may have on science
and society needs further scientific, social and political attention.

3. Study risks

The nature of health and environmental risks associated with
(partly) synthetic organisms to which the familiarity principle no

longer applies and the strategies for managing those risks, clearly
needs more study. Those studies should provide the information
that is needed to define a) what type of organism (or replicable
entities) is still familiar and can be considered ‘bioengineered’ in
terms of regulation, b) how the risks of non-familiar synthetic
organisms should be assessed, and c) what effective management
strategies are, including technological options, to minimize risks.

4. Consider social and ethical aspects

Social and ethical issues will play an important role in the public
and political acceptance of the technology. The present scientific
debate is strongly dominated by natural scientists. In this setting,
there is a risk of the social and ethical issues being neglected or
insufficiently understood. Integration of social scientists (ethi-
cists, philosophers, sociologists, economists, legal experts,
etcetera) in this debate could improve mutual understanding of
technological and sociopolitical phenomena, and thereby improve
internal decision making in the scientific community and commu-
nication with non-science stakeholders. In such a setting, the eth-
ical and social impact of synthetic biology can be given the
serious consideration required for a balanced approach and 
societal success.

5.

6.

Involve social organizations and politicians
At the same time, in modern society stakeholders other than 
scientists are demanding to be involved in the R&D decision-
making process. It is important to give NGOs and politicians a
constructive role in the debate by providing them with adequate
information and by supporting capacity building that enables
them to reflect on the pros and cons of developments in synthetic
biology in a systematic way. This debate should not only focus on
the consequences of the technology, but should also include the
research agenda.

Involve ecologists
Such as in genetic modification, ecological aspects also play an
important role in the case of synthetic biology. This will certainly
be one of the major issues societal organizations will focus on. It
is therefore important to involve ecologists actively in the debate
and research programs on synthetic biology.

7. Public communication

Although it seems too early to seek public participation, the
process of communication with the public has to be started at this
stage. The public (i.e., the media) has to be provided with bal-
anced information and public attitudes need to be carefully moni-
tored, preferably by using qualitative methods, such as panel
discussions.

8. Regulation

Regulatory issues need to be identified and probably improved in
view of three main criteria: do regulations a) allow for scientific
development and technological innovation, b) cover real risks
sufficiently, and c) create sufficient trust among public and politi-
cians. 
Self-regulation is a flexible mechanism of regulation that seems
most appropriate for new technologies in an early and uncertain
stage of development, when there are still many unknowns. Mean-
while, the same unknowns can be linked to ‘potential risks’, which
is why others will argue in favor of government regulation. Yet, it
remains to be seen whether and how existing regulation will apply
to synthetic biology. Further reflection is needed on a smart com-
bination of self-regulation and government regulation. 

9. Discuss how to protect intellectual property

The present patent systems risks hindering scientific develop-
ment in synthetic biology, and it therefore needs to be discussed
in terms of a) the applicability of patents at different levels of
integration (parts-devices-systems) and b) alternatives that 
guarantee open access for research.

10. International network

The developing international network of scientists and other
stakeholders interested in the socioeconomic, ethical, ecological
and political consequences of the developments in synthetic 
biology needs support from public authorities.

11. Bring knowledge and people together

For several reasons not all research activities in the field of syn-
thetic biology are actually considered synthetic biology. This
seems to apply to European research activities in particular. In
contrast to the United States, there is no European synthetic biol-
ogy community yet. The existence of a synthetic biology commu-
nity may create the critical mass that is a prerequisite for a)
furthering the technology, b) the societal reflection on the tech-
nological development and c) developing specific policies for syn-
thetic biology. Creating opportunities for the emergence of such a
community in Europe is a prerequisite for the development of
effective policies. A first advisable step is to organize a meeting
for relevant stakeholders in an exploratory setting.

The process by which either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells are grown
under controlled conditions. In practice the term "cell culture" has come
to refer to the culturing of cells derived from multicellular eukaryotes,
especially animal cells. The historical development and methods of cell
culture are closely interrelated to those of tissue culture and organ culture.

Codon

Trinucleotide unit coding for a single amino acid.

Directed evolution

DNA shuffling

A method used in protein engineering to harness the power of Darwinian
selection to evolve proteins with desirable properties not found in nature.
A typical directed evolution experiment involves two steps:
1. Library creation: The gene encoding the protein of interest is
mutated and/or recombined at random to create a large library of gene
variants. Techniques commonly used in this step are error-prone PCR
and DNA shuffling.
2. Library screening: The library is screened by the researcher using a
high-throughput screen to identify mutants or variants that possess the
desired properties. Winner mutants identified in this way then have
their DNA sequenced to understand what mutations have occurred.
The evolved protein is then characterized using biochemical methods.
The Frances H. Arnold Research Group is one of the most important
directed-evolution laboratories.

A method for in vitro recombination, developed as a technique to 
generate mutant genes that would encode proteins with improved or
unique functionality. It consists of a three-step process:
1.the enzymatic digestion of genes, yielding smaller fragments of DNA;
2.the small fragments are then allowed to randomly hybridize and are

filled in to create longer fragments;

3.any full-length, recombined genes that are recreated are amplified via
the polymerase chain reaction.
If a series of alleles or mutated genes is used as a starting point for
DNA shuffling, the result is a library of recombined genes that can be
translated into novel proteins, which can in turn be screened for novel
functions.

DNA base

An essential building block. DNA contains four complementary bases:
adenine, which pairs with thymine, and cytosine, which pairs with 
guanine.

Endoplasmic reticulum

An organelle found in all eukaryotic cells. It is part of the endomem-
brane system. The endoplasmic reticulum modifies proteins, makes
macromolecules, and transfers substances throughout the cell.

Eukaryote

Gene

An organism with a complex cell or cells, in which the genetic material
is organized into a membrane-bound nucleus or nuclei. Eukaryotes
comprise animals, plants, and fungi – which are mostly multicellular –
as well as various other groups that are collectively classified as pro-
tists (many of which are unicellular).

The units of heredity in living organisms, encoded in the organism's
genetic material (usually DNA or RNA), and controlling the physical
development and behavior of the organism.

Hydrogen bond

Kinesin

Ligand

The study of an organism's genome and the functions of the genes.

A series of biochemical reactions by which a molecule of glucose (Glc)
is oxidized to two molecules of pyruvic acid, which serves two princi-
pal functions: generation of high-energy molecules (ATP and NADH),
and production of a variety of six- or three-carbon intermediate
metabolites, which may be removed at various steps in the process for
other intracellular purposes (such as nucleotide biosynthesis). Glycoly-
sis is one of the most universal metabolic processes known, and occurs
(with variations) in many types of cells in nearly all types of organisms.

A combination of modern robotics, data processing and control soft-
ware, liquid handling devices, and sensitive detectors, which allows
researchers to effectively conduct millions of biochemical, genetic or
pharmacological tests in a short period of time.

A type of attractive intermolecular force that exists between two partial
electric charges of opposite polarity, which involves a hydrogen atom.
Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in determining the three-
dimensional structures adopted by proteins and nucleic bases. The
double helical structure of DNA is largely due to hydrogen bonding
between the base pairs, which link one complementary strand to the
other and enable replication.

A class of motor protein dimer found in biological cells. A kinesin
attaches to microtubules, and moves along the tubule in order to 
transport cellular cargo, such as vesicles.

An atom, ion, or molecule that generally donates one or more of its
electrons through a coordinate covalent bond to, or shares its electrons
through a covalent bond with, one or more central atoms or ions. Most
commonly the central atom is a metal or metalloid in inorganic chem-
istry, but ligands are also used in organic chemistry, for example, to
protect functional groups (e.g., BH3 as ligand for the protection of
phosphines), or to stabilize reactive compounds.

m(essenger) RNA

RNA that encodes and carries information from DNA during transcrip-
tion to sites of protein synthesis to undergo translation in order to yield
a gene product.

Metabolomics

The systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific
cellular processes leave behind. The metabolome represents the collec-
tion of all metabolites in a biological organism, which are the end 
products of its gene expression.

as glass, plastic or silicon chip forming an array for the purpose of
expression profiling, monitoring expression levels for thousands of
genes simultaneously.

Minimal genome

Nanotechnology

The smallest set of genes an organism needs to live in a particular 
environment.

Precursor

Prokaryote

A short sequence of nucleotides (RNA or DNA), typically with twenty or
fewer bases. Automated synthesizers allow the synthesis of oligonu-
cleotides up to 160 to 200 bases. Oligonucleotides are often used as
probes for detecting complementary DNA or RNA because they bind
readily to their complements.

A molecular biology technique for enzymatically replicating DNA with-
out using a living organism, such as E. coli or yeast. PCR is commonly
used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of tasks, such
as the detection of hereditary diseases, the identification of genetic 
fingerprints, the diagnosis of infectious diseases, the cloning of genes,
paternity testing, and DNA computing.

A class of lipids that are a major component of all biological mem-
branes, along with glycolipids and cholesterol.

The study of evolutionary relatedness among various groups of organ-
isms. Phylogeny (or phylogenesis) is the origin and evolution of a set of
organisms, usually a set of species.

An enzyme whose central function is associated with polymers of
nucleic acids such as RNA and DNA. The most well-known function of a
polymerase is the catalysis of the production of new DNA or RNA from
an existing DNA or RNA template, a process known as polymerization.

A precursor is a substance from which another, usually more active or
mature, substance is formed (in biological processes especially meta-
bolism). For instance, certain liver enzymes are precursors to insulin.

An organism without a cell nucleus (= karyon), or indeed any other
membrane-bound organelles, in most cases unicellular (in rare cases,
multicellular). Most of the prokaryotes are bacteria.

Protein engineering

The application of science, mathematics, and economics to the process
of developing useful or valuable proteins.

Riboswitch

RNA (Ribonucleic acid)

A part of a messenger RNA molecule that can directly bind a small
target molecule, and whose binding of the target affects the gene's
activity. Thus, an mRNA that contains a riboswitch is directly involved
in regulating its own activity, depending on the presence or absence of
its target molecule.

A nucleic acid polymer consisting of nucleotide monomers. It is tran-
scribed from DNA by enzymes called RNA polymerases and further
processed by other enzymes. RNA serves as the template for transla-
tion of genes into proteins, transferring amino acids to the ribosome to
form proteins, and also translating the transcript into proteins.

(DNA or genome) 
sequencing

The process of determining the nucleotide order of a given DNA fragment,
called the DNA sequence.

Stem cells

Synthetic biology
(COGEM)

Synthetic biology
(European 
Commission)

Synthetic biology
(Synbio)

Systems biology

In animals these are primal undifferentiated cells that retain the ability
to divide and differentiate into other cell types. Stem cells have the
ability to act as a repair system for the body, because they can divide
and differentiate, replenishing other cells as long as the host organism
is alive.

Synthetic biology focuses on the design and synthesis of artificial genes
and complete biological systems, while it also focuses on changing
existing organisms, with the aim of acquiring useful functions.

The engineering of biological components and systems that do not
exist in nature and the re-engineering of existing biological elements; it
is determined on the intentional design of artificial biological systems,
rather than on the understanding of natural biology.

1) the design and construction of biological parts, devices and systems,
and; 2) the redesign of existing, natural biological systems for useful
purposes.

An academic field that seeks to integrate different levels of information
to understand how biological systems function. By studying the rela-
tionships and interactions between various parts of a biological system
(e.g., gene and protein networks involved in cell signaling, metabolic
pathways, organelles, cells, physiological systems, organisms, etc.) it
is hoped that a comprehensible model of the whole system can eventu-
ally be developed.

Vacuole

The process through which a DNA sequence is enzymatically copied by
an RNA polymerase to produce a complementary RNA. Or, in other
words, the transfer of genetic information from DNA to RNA.

Small RNA chains (74–93 nucleotides) that transfer specific amino acids
to a growing polypeptide chain (protein synthesis) at the ribosomal site
of the cell.

A membrane-bounded compartment within some eukaryotic cells that
can serve a variety of secretory, excretory, and storage functions. 
Vacuoles are especially conspicuous in most plant cells.
