# Project Introduction

This page demonstrates the opportunity and background of the project's inception.

## iGEM

The full name of [iGEM](https://igem.org/) is “International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition”. It is a global synthetic biology competition aimed at encouraging students to design and build genetic engineering projects to solve real-world problems through teamwork and scientific innovation. The competition attracts high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students from all around the world. Participants apply interdisciplinary knowledge and use synthetic biology tools to design biological systems and verify their feasibility in the lab. Teams typically propose innovative solutions in areas of global concern, such as healthcare, the environment, or energy.
